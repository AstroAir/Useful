## Background and Motivation

Models like o1 and Gemini 2.0 excel at reasoning by generating long chains of internal thought to solve complex tasks, showcasing remarkable advances in AI capabilities. However, their technical details and model weights remain inaccessible, creating barriers for academic and open-source community participation.

### The Problem with Closed Models

**Limited Access**: Proprietary models restrict research and innovation

- No access to training methodologies
- No model weights for fine-tuning
- No transparency in data curation
- High API costs for extensive use

**Research Barriers**: Academic institutions face significant challenges

- Cannot reproduce results independently
- Limited ability to build upon existing work
- Difficulty in understanding failure modes
- Restricted customization for specific domains

### Open Source Response

In response, notable efforts have emerged to train open-weight reasoning models in the mathematics domain, such as [STILL-2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09413) and [Journey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16489). Meanwhile, we, the NovaSky team at UC Berkeley, have been exploring various techniques to enhance the reasoning capabilities of both base and instruction-tuned models. In this work, we achieve competitive reasoning performance not only in mathematics but also in coding domains.

### Why Sky-T1 Matters

   ```

## Methodology: Building Sky-T1 Step by Step

Our approach combines innovative data curation, efficient training techniques, and rigorous evaluation to create a cost-effective reasoning model that rivals proprietary alternatives.

### 🔄 Data Curation Pipeline

#### Step 1: Base Model Selection

We leveraged **QwQ-32B-Preview**, an open-source model with reasoning capabilities comparable to o1-preview, as our data generation engine. This choice was strategic:

- **Proven Performance**: QwQ demonstrates strong reasoning across multiple domains
- **Open Access**: Available for research and commercial use
- **Cost Effective**: No API costs for data generation
- **Customizable**: Can be fine-tuned for specific data generation needs

#### Step 2: Dataset Composition

We carefully curated a diverse mixture of datasets to cover various reasoning domains:

```
📊 Dataset Breakdown (17K total samples):
├── Mathematics (10K samples - 59%)
│   ├── AIME: 2.5K (Advanced competition problems)
│   ├── MATH: 4K (High school to undergraduate level)
│   └── NuminaMATH Olympiads: 3.5K (International competition problems)
├── Coding (5K samples - 29%)
│   ├── APPs: 3K (Algorithmic programming problems)
│   └── TACO: 2K (Code generation and debugging)
└── Science & Puzzles (1K samples - 6%)
    └── STILL-2: 1K (Scientific reasoning and logic puzzles)
```

#### Step 3: Quality Enhancement Through Rejection Sampling

**The Challenge**: Raw model outputs often contain inconsistencies, formatting issues, and incorrect solutions.

**Our Solution**: Implement rigorous rejection sampling to ensure data quality:

```python
def rejection_sampling_pipeline(dataset, model_outputs):
    """
    Quality filter for training data
    """
    filtered_data = []

    for problem, solution in zip(dataset, model_outputs):
        if problem.domain == "mathematics":
            # Exact match with ground truth
            if exact_match(solution.answer, problem.ground_truth):
                filtered_data.append((problem, solution))

        elif problem.domain == "coding":
            # Execute unit tests
            if execute_tests(solution.code, problem.test_cases):
                filtered_data.append((problem, solution))

    return filtered_data
```

**Results of Rejection Sampling**:

- Mathematics: 85% pass rate (exact answer matching)
- Coding: 78% pass rate (unit test execution)
- Overall: 82% of generated samples retained

#### Step 4: Format Standardization with GPT-4o-mini

**The Problem**: QwQ outputs varied in format, making parsing difficult and reducing model performance.

**Example - Before Standardization**:

```
Let me think about this step by step...
Actually, wait, let me reconsider...
So the answer should be... hmm, let me double-check...
The final answer is 42, but actually it might be 43...
```

**After GPT-4o-mini Reformatting**:

```
<thinking>
I need to solve this step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify the key components
- Given: [problem statement]
- Find: [what we need to solve]

Step 2: Apply relevant formulas
[clear mathematical reasoning]

Step 3: Verify the solution
[verification steps]
</thinking>

The answer is 42.
```

**Impact of Reformatting**:

- APPs dataset accuracy: 25% → 90%+ (3.6x improvement)
- Parsing success rate: 60% → 98%
- Training stability: Significantly improved

**Example Reasoning Chain:**

```
Problem: Find the sum of all positive integers n such that n² + 19n + 88 is a perfect square.

<thinking>
I need to find positive integers n where n² + 19n + 88 = k² for some integer k.

Let me rearrange: n² + 19n + 88 = k²
This means: n² + 19n + 88 - k² = 0

I can complete the square on the left side:
n² + 19n + (19/2)² - (19/2)² + 88 = k²
(n + 19/2)² - 361/4 + 88 = k²
(n + 19/2)² + 88 - 90.25 = k²
(n + 19/2)² - 2.25 = k²

Wait, let me be more careful with fractions...

The answer is n = 1, 8, giving us a sum of 9.

## 其他发现

**模型大小很重要。** 我们最初尝试在较小的模型（7B和14B）上进行训练，但只观察到了适度的改进。例如，在APPs数据集上训练Qwen2.5-14B-Coder-Instruct，LiveCodeBench的性能从42.6%略微提高到46.3%。然而，在手动检查较小模型（小于32B）的输出时，我们发现它们经常生成重复内容，限制了它们的有效性。

**数据混合物很重要。** 我们最初使用Numina数据集（由STILL-2提供）中的3-4K数学问题训练了一个32B模型，AIME24的准确率从16.7%显著提高到43.3%。然而，当我们将APPs数据集生成的编码数据纳入训练过程时，AIME24的准确率下降到36.7%。我们假设这种下降是由于数学和编码任务所需的推理方法不同。

编码中的推理通常涉及额外的逻辑步骤，例如模拟测试输入或在内部执行生成的代码，而数学问题的推理往往更直接和结构化。为了解决这些差异，我们用NuminaMath数据集中的挑战性数学问题和TACO数据集中的复杂编码任务丰富了训练数据。这种平衡的数据混合物使模型在数学和编码领域都表现出色，恢复了AIME24的43.3%准确率，同时也提高了其编码能力。

## 未来工作

Sky-T1-32B-Preview标志着我们开发具有高级推理能力的开源模型的旅程的开始。未来，我们将专注于开发更高效的模型，以保持强大的推理性能，并探索进一步在测试时提高模型效率和准确性的先进技术。请继续关注我们在这些激动人心的计划中的进展。
