# C++ Type Erasure

Type erasure is a powerful design pattern in C++ that allows you to create uniform interfaces for different types while hiding their specific implementation details. This section provides comprehensive coverage of various type erasure techniques and their applications.

## Overview

Type erasure enables you to:
- Create generic interfaces that work with multiple types
- Hide implementation details from client code
- Achieve runtime polymorphism without inheritance
- Build flexible and extensible APIs

## Type Erasure Techniques

### [Basic Type Erasure Concepts](cpp.md)
Introduction to type erasure fundamentals:
- What is type erasure and why use it
- Basic implementation patterns
- Advantages and trade-offs
- When to choose type erasure over other approaches

### [Virtual Function Approach](cpp_virtual_table.md)
Traditional polymorphism-based type erasure:
- Using base classes and virtual functions
- Virtual table implementation details
- Performance characteristics
- Best practices and limitations

### [std::variant Approach](variant.md)
Modern C++17 type-safe union approach:
- Using std::variant for type erasure
- Visitor pattern implementation
- Compile-time type safety
- Performance benefits and limitations

### [CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern)](crtp.md)
Template-based static polymorphism:
- CRTP implementation techniques
- Compile-time polymorphism
- Performance advantages
- Use cases and examples

## C Language Techniques

### [C-Style Type Erasure](c.md)
Type erasure techniques in C:
- Function pointers and void* approach
- Manual vtable implementation
- Memory management considerations
- Interfacing with C++ code

### [C11 Generic Programming](c11_generic.md)
Modern C generic programming:
- _Generic keyword usage
- Type-generic macros
- Compile-time type selection
- Integration with C++ projects

### [C Virtual Table Implementation](c_virtual_table.md)
Manual virtual table implementation in C:
- Creating vtable structures
- Function pointer management
- Object-oriented patterns in C
- Performance considerations

## Implementation Patterns

### Basic Pattern Structure
```cpp
class TypeErasedInterface {
public:
    template<typename T>
    TypeErasedInterface(T&& obj);
    
    void operation();
    
private:
    struct Concept {
        virtual ~Concept() = default;
        virtual void operation() = 0;
    };
    
    template<typename T>
    struct Model : Concept {
        Model(T obj) : object(std::move(obj)) {}
        void operation() override { object.operation(); }
        T object;
    };
    
    std::unique_ptr<Concept> pimpl;
};
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Virtual dispatch overhead** - Runtime function call costs
- **Memory allocation** - Heap allocation for type-erased objects
- **Cache locality** - Impact on CPU cache performance
- **Compile-time optimization** - Template instantiation costs

### Design Trade-offs
- **Flexibility vs Performance** - Runtime flexibility vs compile-time optimization
- **Type Safety vs Genericity** - Compile-time checks vs runtime adaptability
- **Memory Usage vs Speed** - Memory overhead vs execution speed
- **Complexity vs Maintainability** - Implementation complexity vs code clarity

## Use Cases

### Library Design
- Creating generic container interfaces
- Plugin architectures
- Callback systems
- Event handling frameworks

### API Design
- Hiding implementation details
- Providing stable interfaces
- Supporting multiple backends
- Enabling runtime configuration

### Performance-Critical Code
- Avoiding virtual function overhead
- Compile-time polymorphism
- Template-based solutions
- Zero-cost abstractions

## Best Practices

### When to Use Type Erasure
- ✅ Need runtime polymorphism without inheritance
- ✅ Want to hide template complexity from users
- ✅ Building plugin or callback systems
- ✅ Creating stable ABI boundaries

### When to Avoid Type Erasure
- ❌ Performance is absolutely critical
- ❌ Types are known at compile time
- ❌ Simple inheritance hierarchy suffices
- ❌ Memory usage is severely constrained

### Implementation Guidelines
- Prefer stack allocation when possible
- Use small buffer optimization for common cases
- Consider move semantics for efficiency
- Provide clear error handling
- Document performance characteristics

Each technique includes detailed examples, performance analysis, and practical applications to help you choose the right approach for your specific use case.
