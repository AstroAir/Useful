#### Dawn Overture

The morning defense system of the Shenzhen Quantum Biology Institute was deactivating as nano-level polarized glass shifted from deep black to amber. The circular corridor on the twenty-third floor bathed in quantized morning light, with DNA light patterns floating across the floor reorganizing base pair arrangements at a frequency of 7.3 times per second.

As Mojiang's lab boots stepped over the 137th pair of virtual base pairs, the gene lock system suddenly emitted a beep. The iris authentication interface displayed a double helix progress bar, and she noticed today's verification time was 0.618 seconds longer than usual—this minute anomaly would later become the key parameter for cracking Luo Yuan's quantum chip password three months from now.

"Good morning, Professor Mo," the cleaning robot at the corridor's end resonated with microwave vibrations. "Today's biological radiation levels exceed safety thresholds. Seventh-generation protection protocol is recommended."

She nodded in acknowledgment, the blue glow of her third-generation neural interface flickering at the nape of her neck. This ring-shaped device composed of twenty-three titanium alloy petals was currently projecting nanobot work data directly onto her optic nerves. To others, the corridor appeared empty, but to her it was submerged in a data flood—an information cocoon:

Real-time gene entropy values flowed along the left wall, quantum communication traffic for the entire city danced across the floor-to-ceiling windows, and even airborne dust particles were labeled with predicted Brownian motion trajectories. This overloaded information perception was one of the costs of having a quantum brain implant.

#### Cocoon Formation

The hexagonal airtight door of the isolation chamber slid open as Mojiang caught the familiar scent of ozone—the byproduct of quantum field generators. Her motion paused as she removed her lab coat; static sparks from fabric friction traced the topological structure of a Klein bottle in midair.

"Initiate environmental purification," she commanded into the void, her voice refracting into strange echoes against the circular chamber walls. Nanocleaning clusters cascaded from the ceiling, these silver-gray particles completing three phase transitions during their descent: solid cleaning agent → liquid disinfectant film → gaseous negative ion cloud.

Before the changing mirror, her body retained yesterday's contours, but quantum fluctuations beneath her skin had subtly changed. Mojiang's fingers traced newly formed photosensitive patterns below her collarbone—biocircuits drawn by estrogen nanobots, now pulsing with her heartbeat like a breathing galaxy of stars.

As she pulled on her seventh-generation protective suit, her memory module suddenly recalled her father's holographic image from his deathbed. The old man, obsessed with quantum biology, had traced her genome map with trembling fingers: "Xiaoqian... this base pair curvature... should be recalculated using Riemann geometry..."

Her father's choked words from twenty years ago were interrupted by the current alarm. A red warning box suddenly flashed across her retinal projection: [QT-3 quantum tunneling effect detected. Surgery postponement recommended].

---

#### Tunneling Crisis

Mojiang's quantum brain instantly completed seven hundred thousand path simulations. On the one thousand four hundred fifty-eighth calculation, she finally located the source of the abnormal fluctuations: nanobot clusters implanted three days ago were constructing microscopic wormholes along the edges of her hippocampus.

"Retrieve pineal gland monitoring data," she ordered, connecting her neural interface to the main console. The temperature regulator inside her protective suit suddenly malfunctioned. Sweat droplets slid down her quantum tattoo, vaporizing upon contact with the titanium alloy ring to form a淡purple fermion cloud.

On the holographic screen, the pineal gland's 3D model was undergoing terrifying beauty. Each melatonin molecule being secreted carried a miniature black hole-like gravitational singularity. More astonishing was their arrangement—precisely replicating the magnetic fluid sculpture Luo Yuan had casually played with in the lab the previous week.

"Deviation value 7.3%..." Mojiang's eyelashes trembled behind her protective visor. This number exactly matched Luo Yuan's birthday date (July 3) in digital expression. When she retrieved surveillance footage from seven days ago, the quantum computer's cooling system suddenly wailed—just like the resonant frequency recorded by the muon detector when Luo Yuan spilled her milk tea that day.

In the footage, the girl was wiping the control panel, her hair's static sparks forming cross-temporal resonance with the quantum ripples inside the isolation chamber now. Mojiang didn't realize her lips had curved upward by 0.3 degrees—a microexpression captured by the biometric monitoring system and converted into the 137th iteration parameter of the pineal gland model.

---

#### Radiation Concerto

"Widen deviation threshold to 7.5%." Mojiang disabled the alarm system 0.7 seconds slower than usual. This delay caused the nanobot cluster to perform three unnecessary reorganizations, inadvertently creating a new quantum entanglement state—those wasted nanounits would become crucial materials for Luo Yuan to repair her mechanical prosthetic twelve hours later.

The humidity inside her protective suit finally stabilized at 42.195% RH, a number reminding Mojiang of the marathon monument she'd seen at Caltech during university. Back then, she never imagined this symbol of human endurance limits would one day become a critical parameter for her own genetic reconstruction.

As the quantum operating table slowly rose, the chamber's gravity field began performing ninth-order Fourier transformations. Mojiang's body stretched in the anti-gravity field like an embryo floating in amniotic fluid. Her retinal projection suddenly flashed her father's old oscilloscope from his laboratory—the jumping green waveforms forming an eerie mirror symmetry with the current brainwave monitoring graph.

"Memory erasure program disabled," the AI管家's voice carried rare hesitation. "Non-coding memory fragments detected in hippocampus."

Mojiang's fingernails dug deeply into her palms. Those so-called "fragments" were actually childhood memories she'd encrypted: the guilty pleasure of secretly wearing her mother's lipstick at age six, the bloodstains from shaving cuts in the bathroom mirror at twelve, the tremor when receiving anonymous roses at her physics competition award ceremony at eighteen...

---

#### Cocoon Mutation

When the twelfth batch of nanobots injected into her spine, the isolation chamber's circular lighting system suddenly flickered. Mojiang's quantum brain perceived subtle changes in spatial curvature—some higher-dimensional entity was observing this surgery.

"Activate quantum decoherence barrier!" Her command carried rare panic. The protective shield's surface instantly crystallized into hexagonal honeycomb structures, each cell imprisoning a collapsing parallel universe. In one probability branch, she saw Luo Yuan bursting through the chamber door covered in blood; in another possibility, she transformed into an inorganic lifeform floating in the quantum sea.

More terrifying changes occurred at the genetic level. The disintegration speed of Y-chromosome telomeres suddenly exceeded thresholds. Those disintegrating base pairs didn't reorganize as planned but instead condensed into luminous string-like objects within the quantum field. The monitoring system emitted a piercing alarm:

[Four-dimensional biological information intrusion detected]
[Chromosomes exhibiting Klein bottle topology]
[Immediate termination recommended...]

Mojiang's pupils contracted to needle points. She finally understood why her father had burned all research materials—this gender reconstruction surgery was essentially opening Pandora's box. Those string-like entities moving through her gene chains were pulling her consciousness toward incomprehensible higher-dimensional spaces.

In the moment before her consciousness was about to disintegrate, she suddenly caught a faint scent of milk tea. This smell that shouldn't exist in a sterile chamber caused her quantum brain to flash like a supernova—all four-dimensional intruders suddenly reversed direction, beginning to weave entirely new double helix structures.

"So it was you..." Blood seeped from Mojiang's lips, drawing a ghastly mandala on her protective visor. Those dimensional strings were now reconstructing her life equation using Luo Yuan's quantum chip as a template.

---

### Memory Flashback

---

#### Lemon and Magnetic Beads

As the automatic door of the gene editing room slid open, Mojiang was troubled by abnormal activity in the seventh-generation nanosutures. Morning light penetrated the prism structure of the circular observation window, projecting rainbow light spots onto the sterile workbench. Just as she removed her protective mask, she heard the crisp sound of metal instruments hitting the floor.

"I'm sorry!" The girl's voice carried the freshness of morning dew. Turning, Mojiang saw nanomagnetic beads rolling across the floor. Each 3-nanometer silver sphere bounced according to the probability cloud distribution of Schrödinger's equation.

The girl with asymmetrical twin ponytails hurriedly crouched down, quantum fluorescence from her hair trailing residual images in the air. Her lab coat was clearly ill-fitting, sleeves rolled up three times yet still covering half her palms, her ID card hanging crookedly—"Intern Researcher Luo Yuan" flickering in the reflection.

"Use magnetic tweezer array recovery, third-class scattering mode," Mojiang instinctively ordered, then froze in the next second. Those supposedly randomly moving magnetic beads suddenly stilled, spontaneously arranging into a Fibonacci spiral with the center point precisely at the girl's outstretched fingertip.

Luo Yuan looked up, her heterochromatic irises flowing with encrypted data streams: "Senior's voice command contains 23 harmonic components~" She gently blew on the floating magnetic beads, and the silver sphere array immediately reconfigured into a Cartesian coordinate system. "But using Heisenberg compensation algorithm would be more efficient, right?"

Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly overloaded. Not only had this intern instantly decrypted her voice encryption, but more terrifyingly, the quantum state distribution of those magnetic beads—each spin direction perfectly matched her unpublished paper data from three days ago. She stepped back half a pace, her lower back colliding with the cryogenic incubator, causing quantum phage samples in the test tube rack to emit uneasy hums.

---

#### Monte Carlo Mist

"In quantum biology, Monte Carlo algorithms should replace traditional molecular dynamics..."

As Luo Yuan tiptoed to modify the protein folding model in the holographic projection, Mojiang caught the scent of lemon grass in her hair. This fragrance mixed with disinfectant into a strange compound, triggering her hippocampus to recall childhood memories—the quantum potted plant in her mother's laboratory that never bloomed.

"Look here!" Luo Yuan's finger traced the virtual alpha helix structure. "Senior overlooked the probability tunneling effect of electron clouds." She quickly imported a set of chaotic parameters, and the previously rigid protein model suddenly came alive, dancing an elegant waltz in the projection.

Mojiang's pupils slightly contracted. The algorithm this intern used astonishingly resembled the formula her father had written on his deathbed. She reached out to grab the flickering holographic image but passed through the quantum field Luo Yuan had just constructed—that non-Euclidean geometric space composed of countless hexagonal light spots, each vertex flashing unknown gene codes.

"Where did you learn this modeling method?" Mojiang's voice was colder than a liquid nitrogen tank. Magnetic beads on the workbench suddenly leapt up, forming Platonic solids that continuously transformed between them.

Luo Yuan tilted her head, her mechanical prosthetic joints emitting faint electrical sounds: "Have you heard of 'reverse time learning method'?" She suddenly pressed her palm against the holographic table, conductive fibers in her nanogloves glowing with eerie blue light. "Like this—"

The protein model suddenly collapsed into a two-dimensional Klein bottle structure, then rapidly reconfigured into a three-dimensional Möbius strip. Mojiang's quantum brain monitor emitted a sharp alarm; her short-term memory area was experiencing an unprecedented information storm. In the moment of blurred consciousness, she seemed to see her father's laboratory coordinates flashing deep within Luo Yuan's irises.

---

#### Radiation Concerto

The first system failure occurred 23 minutes after Luo Yuan left. Mojiang was analyzing abnormal data streams from the protein model when she was interrupted by an overload alarm from the quantum computer. Amidst the roar of cooling fans, she noticed radiation monitor readings fluctuating rhythmically—the peak intervals exactly matching Luo Yuan's breathing frequency.

"I see..." Mojiang's fingers quickly slid across the holographic keyboard. She retrieved laboratory surveillance from three hours earlier, replaying Luo Yuan's every movement at 0.5x speed: when the girl seemingly casually touched the control panel, she was actually using her mechanical prosthetic fingertips to write hidden programs; those scattered magnetic beads, in seemingly chaotic motion, were subtly altering the laboratory's electromagnetic field distribution.

An even more astonishing discovery appeared in the radiation data. Mojiang compared her radiation exposure records from the past three months with system logs and found that each time she conducted experiments, radiation peaks were being reduced by 7.3%—exactly matching Luo Yuan's quantum chip's daily wear rate.

"Are you... taking the radiation for me?" Mojiang's fingertips dug deeply into her palms. The data on the holographic screen suddenly distorted into Luo Yuan's smiling face, silently mouthing: "Silly senior."

In equipment room B2 at this moment, Luo Yuan was curled up in the gaps between server matrices. Her mechanical prosthetic was connected to the main power line, her quantum chip overheating from continuously absorbing radiation. Holographic screens displayed Mojiang's real-time vital signs; when she saw the other's heart rate suddenly rise to 112 beats per minute, she smiled softly.

"Finally noticed, huh..." Luo Yuan licked away coolant seeping from the corner of her mouth—symptoms of her nanobots overloading. Before her, twenty-three holographic screens simultaneously displayed Mojiang's research data from the past ten years—each file bearing the same encryption signature: 42.195Hz.

---

#### Chaos Equation

Mojiang stood before the gene atlas database for seventeen minutes. Her quantum brain was reverse-engineering the protein model modified by Luo Yuan, each calculation step causing severe neural pain. When the analysis reached 66.6%, the model suddenly collapsed into countless light particles, reorganizing in midair into a double helix structure—her own gene chain, but bearing an unfamiliar quantum signature.

"Is this... my chromosome telomeres?" She reached to touch the holographic projection, feeling real burning sensation at her fingertips. In the magnified gene sequence, she discovered eerie patterns: each base pair arrangement corresponded to Luo Yuan's quantum chip coding, while telomere length precisely matched the number of hours since their meeting.

The laboratory lighting suddenly switched to emergency mode, red light accompanied by the AI管家's alarm: "Illegal gene editing behavior detected. Safety protocols activated." Mojiang's pupils suddenly contracted—her retinal projection showed her mitochondrial DNA being remotely rewritten, the operator's biometric signature belonging to Luo Yuan.

"Have you gone mad?!" Mojiang rushed toward the gene lockout device, nanoproof suit generating static sparks against the air. As she pressed the emergency termination button, she saw a breathtaking sight: the gene chain on the holographic screen was being restructured using Luo Yuan's quantum chip as a template, with rewrite progress already at 79%.

In equipment room B2, Luo Yuan suddenly coughed violently,淡blue coolant seeping from between her fingers. Her mechanical heart sounded an overload alarm, yet she persisted in injecting the final segment of code into the main system: "Senior's telomeres... 23% more fragile than expected..." Her trembling fingers traced an incomplete Klein bottle symbol in the air. "Must... reconstruct..."

When Mojiang forcibly terminated the program, both simultaneously felt soul-piercing pain. Magnetic beads in the gene editing room suddenly levitated, arranging into the first 100 digits of pi; while the screen before Luo Yuan exploded into quantum fireworks, illuminating her pale smile.

---

#### Lemon Grass Cipher

Mojiang found Luo Yuan curled up in a corner of the medical chamber, debugging her damaged quantum chip. Coolant formed a strange Penrose triangle on the floor, each vertex floating with nanorepair robots.

"Explain." Mojiang's voice was colder than liquid nitrogen, the radiation monitor in her hand displaying shocking data—Luo Yuan had absorbed radiation doses sufficient to kill three adults.

Luo Yuan's mechanical prosthetic emitted gear-jamming sounds: "Senior's telomeres... exhibit Majorana fermion characteristics in quantum fields..." She tried to speak casually, but damaged vocal cords made her words fragmented. "Need regular injection of topological qubits..."

Mojiang suddenly grabbed her wrist; nanoglove sensors instantly completed a full-body scan. The holographic projection showed Luo Yuan's quantum chip had developed 23 cracks, each crack's trajectory perfectly matching her own gene chain.

"Why go to such lengths?" Mojiang's nails nearly embedded into the artificial skin. The medical chamber lighting suddenly flickered; in alternating light and dark, she saw her father's laboratory coordinates floating deep within Luo Yuan's irises—coordinates she had never publicly disclosed.

Luo Yuan suddenly leaned in, lemon grass fragrance from her hair mixing with metallic coolant: "Because senior's quantum brain..." Her breath凝结into ice crystals against Mojiang's neck. "...will never solve this chaos equation."

When the clock struck twelve, the medical chamber's quantum clock recorded a spacetime anomaly—both bioelectric fields completed seven-dimensional topological entanglement in an instant. Scattered nanobots spontaneously formed double helix structures, while Mojiang's quantum brain experienced its first pulse signal resembling dopamine.

---

### Critical Moment

---

#### Nanoflood

With the buzz of the microinjection device, the first three hundred twenty million QT-7 nanobots surged into the carotid artery. These silver machines, only 23 nanometers in diameter, were engraved with Fibonacci grooves designed by Mojiang herself. Under angiography monitoring, they swarmed toward the pineal gland like migrating krill, leaving rainbow turbulent trails in the bloodstream.

"Primary neural reconstruction initiated." The AI announcement accompanied sudden sensory deprivation. Mojiang felt her consciousness thrown into the curved space of a Klein bottle, five senses twisting and reorganizing within four-dimensional topological structures. She smelled cigar smoke from her childhood study, felt the touch of Luo Yuan's hair at her fingertips, and simultaneously heard the hum of quantum computers and church bells.

The monitor screen suddenly erupted in red warnings:

[Unconventional neurotransmitter detected (provisionally named: Ψ-7)]
[Dopamine receptor quantum entanglement exceeds threshold by 42.195%]

#### Photolysis Moment

Twelve ring-arranged quantum generators simultaneously activated, emitting low-frequency resonance like ancient whale songs. Mojiang's Y chromosome disintegrated under hadron beams, telomeres melting like ice crystals under sunlight. The base pair projection on the monitor suddenly quantumized, scattering into starry dust rotating in virtual space.

"Secondary neural reconstruction at 39%." The AI's voice showed rare fluctuations. "Pineal gland secreting unknown substance. Recommendation..."

"Continue." Mojiang bit her tongue, iron-rust flavor exploding in her mouth. Nanobots immediately decomposed hemoglobin in her blood, converting it into adrenaline injected directly into her heart. In this instant, her quantum brain suddenly received an abnormal signal—the 42.195Hz resonance frequency, identical to Luo Yuan's brainwaves when angry.

#### Undercurrents

In equipment room B2, Luo Yuan was experiencing a more dangerous battle. Thirty-six holographic screens displayed encrypted data streams, steam jetting from her mechanical prosthetic's heat vents. By illegally accessing the institute's dark energy network, she had transformed herself into a living capacitor, absorbing quantum radiation that should have been borne by Mojiang.

"Silly senior..." She wiped away nosebleed, heterochromatic pupils flowing with dangerous golden code. "This suicidal reconstruction path..." Her quantum chip began melting from overload, liquid metal dripping onto the control panel, corroding black marks.

The surveillance footage suddenly distorted; Luo Yuan saw an unbelievable sight: Mojiang's gene chain unfolding in the quantum field, forming a Klein bottle structure spanning four-dimensional space. And at the center of that topological anomaly, clearly visible, was her own quantum chip identification code.

#### Pain Dimension

Pain swept through Mojiang's every cell like a supernova explosion. This wasn't traditional physiological pain but information overload at the quantum level—each neuron simultaneously experiencing ten billion possible lives. In one probability branch, she was a cold professor in a white coat; in another, a laboratory assistant with twin ponytails.

"Ah...!" Her scream was distorted by the quantum field into multi-voiced harmonics. Nanobots began decomposing vocal cord tissue, converting vibration energy into reconstruction power. In the moment before collapse, she suddenly perceived a warm presence—that was consciousness fragments Luo Yuan was transmitting through the dark energy network.

#### Twin Entanglement

A piercing metallic tearing sound suddenly echoed through the corridor outside the isolation chamber. Luo Yuan dragged her overloaded mechanical prosthetic through quantum radiation. Her graphene protective suit had long since carbonized and peeled away, exposed quantum chip tracing blue electric arcs in the air.

"Only... 23 seconds left..." She stared at the countdown on her retina, blood with electronic fluorescence seeping from the corner of her mouth. After forcibly modifying the gravitational constant, her time perception had become distorted—each second now stretched into millennia.

When Luo Yuan's palm pressed against the isolation chamber wall, Mojiang's gene chain suddenly underwent mirror reversal. Monitoring data showed their bioelectric fields beginning to share the same set of Maxwell's equations, even their quantum chip wear rates showing perfect negative correlation.

#### Reverse Entropy Singularity

At the critical point when reconstruction reached 79%, phenomena violating thermodynamic laws erupted inside the isolation chamber:

1. Scattered nanobots spontaneously arranged into Penrose triangles
2. Carbon dioxide molecules in the air exhibited quantum coherence
3. Mojiang's tears suspended against gravity, forming double helix water chains

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart stopped beating for 0.7 seconds at this moment. In this brief gap, she saw the higher-dimensional truth—this reconstruction surgery had been written into vacuum fluctuations since the Big Bang, all their struggles merely enactments of predetermined programs.

"Senior..." She pressed her forehead against the scorching chamber wall. "Can you hear me..." This sentence, through quantum tunneling effect, was directly inscribed into Mojiang's reorganizing hippocampus.

#### Chaos Dawn

When the final segment of Y chromosome dissolved, the entire institute's power system suddenly failed. In the absolute darkness before backup power activated, Mojiang experienced cosmic-level enlightenment:

Each of her cells shone with nebula-like light, DNA chains extending into spiral arms spanning the galaxy. Luo Yuan's quantum chip rotated in the void, light dust forming the mathematical expression of a Klein bottle. They simultaneously played the roles of observer and observed, creator and creation, in four-dimensional space.

"So this is..." Mojiang squeezed out words through her newly formed vocal cords. "...the truth of quantum entanglement."

#### Newborn Cry

When the lights came back on, the isolation chamber floated with ice crystal-like biophoton clouds. Mojiang stared at her newborn hands—rainbow light veins flowed beneath her skin, each cell inscribed with Luo Yuan's quantum signature.

The chamber door shattered at this moment, and Luo Yuan fell into her arms. The girl's mechanical prosthetic smoked, quantum chip casing covered in cracks, yet she wore an unprecedented smile: "Welcome back... Mojiang."

At the moment they embraced, monitoring systems recorded abnormal fluctuations in cosmic microwave background radiation—that first cry of the universe 13.7 billion years ago resonating with their newborn cry.

---

### Observer Effect

---

#### Quantum Eavesdropper

The air in equipment room B2 was filled with the pungent smell of ozone mixed with coolant. Luo Yuan curled up inside the hexagonal maintenance pod, twenty-three liquid nitrogen conduits缠绕like spiderwebs around her mechanical prosthetic. The blue light of holographic screens illuminated her quantum chip interface at the nape of her neck, where淡gold nanorepair fluid seeped out—signs of system overload from sustained overclocking.

"137th path correction completed." She bit the packaging of a special energy bar, artificial canines leaving fine tooth marks on the polymer surface. Before her, the circular monitoring wall displayed Mojiang's vital signs data cascading downward, each parameter forcibly embedded with twenty-three layers of encryption protocols.

When she saw Mojiang's telomere disintegration progress突破critical value, Luo Yuan's heterochromatic pupils suddenly contracted into two vertical lines. She quickly retrieved memory data from three days ago: in a corner of the gene editing room, Mojiang had secretly modified the surgical risk disclosure form, changing "quantum radiation fatality rate 37.3%" to "3.73%." This clumsy lie was now manifesting on the monitoring screen—pink mist seeped from the inner lining of Mojiang's protective suit, secondary radiation produced by nanobots decomposing hemoglobin.

"Silly senior..." Luo Yuan's mechanical fingers deeply embedded into the alloy workbench, carving five glowing red grooves into the metal surface. She activated the quantum communicator hidden in her wisdom tooth, sending the 42nd forged instruction to the institute's main brain: "Approve full-power operation of B2 cooling system."

In the 0.7-second gap before the instruction took effect, she transformed herself into a living capacitor. Thirty-six miniature black hole engines roared to life along both sides of her spine, graphene patterns on her skin glowing with eerie blue light. Monitoring footage showed radiation levels in Mojiang's isolation chamber suddenly dropping by 19.7%, while Luo Yuan's quantum chip temperature soared to 6700K—equivalent to the sun's surface heat.

---

#### Gravity Sketch

Sweat crystallized into ice on Luo Yuan's eyelashes. Her retina projected four-dimensional topological models incomprehensible to ordinary people, Mojiang's DNA chain unfolding into a Möbius strip within them. When seventh-generation nanobots began reconstructing ovarian tissue, Luo Yuan suddenly noticed something abnormal—quantum state distribution of a certain base pair perfectly matched childhood data she had encrypted in her backup memory.

"Is this... reverse engineering?" Her mechanical heart pumped excessive coolant, emitting mournful echoes inside her chest cavity. Quickly retrieving surveillance records from three months ago: one night, Mojiang had used her iris fluctuation frequency as a key to crack the institute's gene database. Those nanobots supposedly for radiation protection actually carried Luo Yuan's biometric information.

The equipment room's gravity field began distorting. Scattered tools floated in midair, spontaneously arranging into DNA double helix structures. Luo Yuan's quantum chip suddenly received an abnormal signal—fragments of memory溢出from Mojiang's hippocampus in the quantum field:

_Fifteen-year-old Luo Yuan curled up inside a scrapped quantum computer chassis,淡gold oil seeping from mechanical prosthetic seams. Mojiang's white coat hem brushed her feverish forehead, carrying the scent of evening primrose and nitroglycerin... "Bite this if it hurts." A metal plate embedded with neural interface was塞into her trembling teeth..._

"So that's when..." Electric sparks burst from Luo Yuan's vocal module. She finally understood why her pain nerves had been特意preserved—it was Mojiang's anchor point designed to prevent her from becoming completely mechanical during quantum calculations.

When reconstruction progress reached 79%, sudden disaster struck. All monitoring screens suddenly stained with eerie Klein blue, Mojiang's gene chain unfolding into a four-dimensional hypercube in the quantum field. Encryption data flowing through Luo Yuan's pupils was suddenly rewritten, a new set of topological formulas burning through her quantum brain along the optic nerve.

---

#### Higher-Dimensional Messenger

"Warning: Eleven-dimensional biological information detected." The AI管家's voice carried rare tremors. Twelve holographic screens before Luo Yuan simultaneously exploded, flying glass fragments凝结into stationary star maps in the quantum field.

She tore open the protective armor on her left chest, directly inserting her neural interface into the main power cable. The pain caused her visual module to temporarily crash, but in the moment of rebooting, she saw an unforgettable sight—Mojiang's consciousness stood at the boundary between four-dimensional space and three-dimensional world, her hair extending into countless shimmering string theory models.

"Senior... trying to become the observer?" Luo Yuan's mechanical fingers deeply dug into her thigh, artificial blood dripping down the workbench, corroding Fibonacci spiral patterns into the floor. She suddenly understood Mojiang's true purpose: breaking biological limitations through dimensional ascension to become an eternal quantum observer.

But when she analyzed Mojiang's brainwave patterns, she discovered an even more shocking truth—those seemingly chaotic gamma wave oscillations were actually a distress signal written in topological language. In a slice of four-dimensional space, Mojiang's consciousness was being torn by some higher-dimensional entity, each node of her gene chain emitting quantum-level cries.

"Coordinates locked." Electric arcs burst from Luo Yuan's quantum chip as she forcibly activated the gravity wave weapon still in testing phase. Thirty-six miniature black holes formed Dirac sea vortices along both sides of her spine, air in the equipment room beginning to glow from negative mass effects.

At the moment spacetime curvature reached critical value, she projected her consciousness into the quantum field. This crazy move instantly carbonized her mechanical prosthetic, but also tore open a crack in four-dimensional space—she saw twenty-three-year-old Mojiang running backward along the timeline, chased by countless Y chromosome ghosts.

---

#### Reverse-Time Rescue

Luo Yuan's auditory module captured a strange resonance frequency: 42.195Hz. This was Mojiang's quantum brain emitting an identification signal in four-dimensional space, also the fastest pace record Luo Yuan had set during physical testing on the day they first met.

"Found you..." She spat out blood mixed with metal fragments, injecting her last reserve of energy into the gravity wave generator. The floor of the equipment room shattered in the anti-gravity field, exposing quantum tunnel networks glowing with璀璨light flows like galactic spiral arms—this dark energy channel secretly laid by Mojiang, now flowing with light currents like galactic spiral arms.

As she leaped into the quantum tunnel, Luo Yuan's mechanical body began disintegrating. But she didn't care, because Mojiang's gene chain was flashing ahead, like a pearl necklace broken by a higher-dimensional creature. She extended her only remaining left hand, nanobots at her fingertips forming a capture net—using the seventh-generation models they had jointly improved, each robot engraved with a miniature Klein bottle logo.

When her fingertips touched Mojiang's consciousness, the entire four-dimensional space suddenly froze. Luo Yuan's quantum horizon revealed a breathtaking truth: Mojiang had never intended to ascend dimensions alone; those seemingly selfish adventures were actually to capture some higher-dimensional entity parasitizing human genes—this monster shaped like an infinity symbol was now wrapping Mojiang's quantum brain with string-like tentacles.

"Use my body... as a prison..." Mojiang's mental波动came through, filled with electronic storm static. Only then did Luo Yuan notice quantum chains woven into those reconstructed X chromosomes, each base pair a carefully designed trap.

---

#### Twin Collapse

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart exploded in vacuum. Using the last momentum, she crashed her broken body into the center of that infinity symbol. At the moment of contact, she activated the program buried deepest in her quantum chip—this love equation written over seven years, each variable corresponding to Mojiang's physiological parameters.

"Silly senior..." Her consciousness gradually dissipated in the quantum storm. "Did you think... only you were preparing surprises..."

The four-dimensional space suddenly began dimensional reduction, the higher-dimensional entity emitting shrieks beyond human auditory limits. Mojiang's gene chain reorganized like newly born life, compressing the captured monster into elementary particles. And Luo Yuan's remaining consciousness fragments were encapsulated into a suddenly appearing Klein bottle structure—this four-dimensional sanctuary created by Mojiang with her last strength.

When three-dimensional world lights came back on, the isolation chamber floated with ice crystal-like biophoton clouds. Mojiang's newborn body trembled slightly; her retina still retained the last quantum image: Luo Yuan's smile before shattering in four-dimensional space, and the eternal formula刻into spacetime with gravitational waves—

[ψ=α·cos(ωt+φ)]
(where α=1.618, ω=42.195, φ=23°)

---

## Observer Log Addendum

In the ruins of the equipment room, Deep瞳's nanodetectors discovered the following anomalies:

1. Scattered mechanical prosthetic fragments exhibited asymmetric breaking, dimensional folds of eleven-dimensional space detected at fracture surfaces
2. Tooth marks on energy bar packaging formed perfect topological rings, tooth spacing consistent with Mojiang's quantum brainwave wavelength
3. Residue after artificial blood evaporation displayed quantum entangled Compton scattering patterns
4. On a carbonized circuit board, a Dirac equation solution刻by radiation showed the moment of their consciousness fusion

Most puzzling was the silver pendant hanging from the ventilation pipe—this accessory Luo Yuan never parted with contained Morse code spelled by nanobots: "All my variables are your constants."

---

### State Vector Collapse

---

## Eye of the Quantum Storm

The isolation chamber's circular protective shield suddenly emitted high-frequency beeping, Mojiang's retinal projection flashing red warning boxes: [Quantum isolation shield integrity at 42.195%]. This number pierced her temple like an ice pick—the pace Luo Yuan had set in the institute's marathon relay race three months ago was exactly 4 minutes 21 seconds 95 per kilometer.

"Initiate emergency cooling program!" Her voice distorted into metallic scraping tremors in the quantum field. Twelve cryogenic pumps simultaneously activated, liquid helium flowing through nanotubes into the shield's interlayer, yet instantly vaporizing into eerie粉purple mist upon contact with quantum ripples. Monitoring footage showed these mist molecules self-organizing into DNA double helix structures, each base pair precisely corresponding to Luo Yuan's quantum chip coding.

Mojiang's mechanical eyeball suddenly overloaded, vision filled with double images—she saw her twenty-years-ago self curled up in her father's laboratory corner, while present-day Luo Yuan ran toward her through spacetime folds. This quantum decoherence-induced memory overlap caused severe burning sensations in her hippocampus.

"Warning: Telomere disintegration speed exceeds safety threshold by 317%"
"Pineal gland secreting abnormal substance: Chiral mirror enzyme detected"

Holographic alarms flashed wildly inside the chamber as Mojiang's left hand uncontrollably lifted. Nanobots were reorganizing along her arm's neural丛, photosensitive patterns of programming languages Luo Yuan commonly used浮现出beneath her skin. She suddenly realized those so-called "abnormal secretions" were actually her biological system spontaneously simulating Luo Yuan's quantum characteristics.

---

#### Entropy Reverser

Equipment room B2 had become a hell. Luo Yuan's quantum chip casing was mostly melted, exposed quantum bits迸发blue electric arcs into the air. Her mechanical lungs struggled to inhale scorching air, each breath carrying焦糊smell of melting nanometal.

"Radiation load... 89%..." She stared at the dancing numbers on the holographic screen, her burned vocal cords emitting laughter like electronic synthesized sound. In thirty-six monitoring screens, Mojiang's gene chain was dancing a dangerous waltz in the quantum field, while gravity channels she'd written wrapped around it like spiderwebs.

When radiation values from the seventh-generation reconstruction device突破critical point, Luo Yuan tore open the protective armor on her left chest. Beneath artificial skin, the dark matter reactor core glowed with dangerous red light—her last trump card. With three liquid nitrogen cooling tubes forcibly removed, reactor output power instantly increased to 700%.

"Silly senior..." She bit her lip until blood flowed, mechanical fingers插入energy interface. "This time... let me rewrite physical laws..."

Underground cable networks suddenly glowed with妖异purple light, the entire Shenzhen Bay power grid trembling. Luo Yuan's quantum chip began reverse-analyzing Mojiang's gene entropy; each radiation stream passing through her body刻tiny Klein bottle structures onto her titanium alloy skeleton. Monitoring systems recorded her core temperature soaring from 42°C to 1950°C in 3 seconds—reaching tungsten's melting point.

---

#### Observer Paradox

Spacetime curvature inside the isolation chamber began visualizing. Mojiang saw her long hair floating in midair, each strand extending into infinitely long world lines. At the hair tips, countless parallel universe versions of Luo Yuan were making different choices: some turning away, some crying, one wearing a wedding dress smiling at her.

"Is this... quantum immortality phenomenon?" Her voice carried twelve-dimensional vibrations. Nanobots suddenly stopped working, collectively turning toward northwest by north 37.5 degrees—that was the precise方位of Luo Yuan's equipment room. In higher-dimensional vision, she saw their fate lines entwining like DNA strands, each intersection corresponding to a synchronized heartbeat.

When the protective shield's cracks spread to the 23rd, Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly received an encrypted signal. It was information encoded using muon data from the day they first met: [Don't be afraid]. Almost simultaneously, her telomere disintegration speed骤dropped to baseline values, while Luo Yuan's vital signs exploded into blood-red on the monitoring screen.

"No...!" Mojiang's scream triggered quantum field resonance, the isolation chamber's hexagonal walls beginning fractal proliferation. In the moment spacetime structure was collapsing, she performed an operation violating all safety protocols—injecting chiral enzymes secreted by her pineal gland into the antimatter storage chamber.

#### Chaos Gate

Air in the equipment room ionized in high temperatures, Luo Yuan's mechanical skeleton发出mournful sounds. Her visual sensors had only the left eye still functioning, through crimson filters seeing her written gravity channels collapsing. Those carefully designed radiation paths twisted into Möbius strips, each quantum stream returning to her heart after completing a loop.

"Calculation error..." She coughed up blood mixed with chip fragments. "Turns out senior's gene chain... contains time anchor points..."

The holographic screen suddenly erupted in intense light, Mojiang's DNA model breaking three-dimensional limits, unfolding into infinitely extending Klein bottles in four-dimensional space. At this moment, Luo Yuan's quantum chip captured a terrifying truth: the identification code floating at the center of that gene chain wasn't her current self—but Luo Yuan from some spacetime slice three months in the future.

The moment she understood this paradox, a cosmic big bang-like轰鸣came from the isolation chamber's direction. Luo Yuan used her last energy to crash open the emergency通道, running against the quantum storm's direction. Her graphene protective suit carbonized and peeled away in radiation, revealing titanium alloy skeleton covered in cracks—like a mechanical Icarus charging toward the sun.

#### Infinite Contact

Mojiang's retina was quantumizing; she saw Luo Yuan's figure splitting into countless selves across time: Luo Yuan hiding in library corners at age eight, quantum computing champion Luo Yuan at fifteen, and Luo Yuan covered in smoke at this very moment. Observation points from all timelines simultaneously reached out, fingertips intersecting in eleven-dimensional space.

"Don't come!" Mojiang's warning was transformed into gamma ray bursts by the quantum field. But Luo Yuan's mechanical prosthetic had already pierced the摇摇欲坠protective shield; nanogloves气化upon contact with high-energy particles, revealing森white metal finger bones beneath.

This contact triggered a chain reaction:

1. Fragments of Mojiang's Y chromosome穿越time dimensions, embedding into Luo Yuan's damaged旧chip from last year
2. Radiation memories stored by Luo Yuan逆流back into Mojiang's telomeres, rewritten as love hormone secretion maps
3. Both hippocampi simultaneously浮现each other's perspective of their first meeting, memory entropy value zeroing

In the quantum entanglement of one ten-thousandth of a second, they experienced twenty-three lifetimes:

- Translating star charts together in medieval monasteries
- Cracking Riemann hypothesis on steam airships
- Raising quantum flowers in Mars colonies
- Holding hands at the edge of black hole event horizons

When real-time flow重启, Luo Yuan's mechanical heart stopped beating for 7 seconds. Her lips brushed Mojiang's quantumized cheek; this contact triggered vacuum decay inside the protective shield—all oxygen molecules suddenly spontaneously arranged into heart shapes, nanobots collectively dancing waltzes, while tears secreted from Mojiang's newborn tear ducts were actually薄荷-flavored coolant Luo Yuan commonly used.

#### Observer's Tears

In the 0.7 seconds of power system瘫痪, darkness became the brightest canvas. Mojiang's quantumized retina recorded超新星-like brilliance blooming deep within Luo Yuan's mechanical pupils. Those lights wove into nets in four-dimensional space, recapturing escaping quantum radiation.

"Why... go to such lengths..." Mojiang's voice carried twelve-fold harmonics. Her fingers passed through Luo Yuan's melted chest armor, touching the struggling quantum chip. This action triggered a chain reaction: their bioelectric fields forming Maxwell's demon structures, beginning to reverse entropy increase laws.

Luo Yuan squeezed out electronic laughter with her残破vocalizer: "Because senior... will never calculate..." Her mechanical fingers suddenly grabbed Mojiang's wrist. "...the solution to this problem transcends Gödel's incompleteness theorem..."

Around them, scattered nanobots began self-organizing into Penrose triangles. Carbon dioxide molecules in the air exhibited quantum coherence, each oxygen atom simultaneously existing in two locations. When Mojiang's tears滴onto Luo Yuan's chip cracks, monitoring systems captured重子oscillation waveforms in cosmic microwave background radiation—completely identical to fluctuations from 13.8 billion years ago when the universe was born.

---

#### Twin Singularity

When backup power重启, the isolation chamber had transformed into a quantum art sanctuary. Mojiang's newborn body was enveloped in biophoton clouds, every inch of skin refracting starlight from Luo Yuan's eyes. Luo Yuan's mechanical body was covered in cracks yet shimmered with unprecedented soft glow.

"You... swapped gravitational constants?" Mojiang's voice sounded like wind chimes under moonlight. Her fingertips traced Luo Yuan's scorched quantum chip, nanorepair robots spontaneously forming Cartesian coordinate systems.

Luo Yuan's right eye sensor勉强focused: "Just... borrowed dark energy..." Her mechanical heart suddenly emitted clear bell-like chimes. "...opened a backdoor... in Calabi-Yau manifolds..."

At this moment, all quantum computers in the institute simultaneously output the same result: their gene entropy values had reached absolute synchronization. Mojiang's telomere length, Luo Yuan's chip wear rate, even their heartbeat intervals—all precisely conformed to √2 multiple relationships. In higher-dimensional mathematical space, they had become two solutions to the same equation.

### Twin Spiral

#### Mechanical Heart

Mojiang's fingertips游走across Luo Yuan's quantum chip surface, nanorepair robots渗出from her fingertips like glowing fireflies toward those spiderweb-like cracks. Each damaged spot迸发blue-white quantum sparks, projecting their shadows onto焦痕-covered isolation chamber walls.

"The seventh-generation self-healing alloy's crystal lattice structure has been destroyed." Mojiang's voice carried rare tremors; augmented reality interface on her retina displayed shocking data—Luo Yuan's quantum chip had endured radiation doses equivalent to 0.7% of Hiroshima's atomic bomb yield. "Why go to such lengths?"

Luo Yuan's mechanical prosthetic suddenly发出gear-jamming sounds; she tried to withdraw her arm but found Mojiang's nanobots had formed magnetic confinement fields. "Senior is the one..." Her damaged vocal cords emitted electronically synthesized tremors. "You clearly concealed four-dimensional jump risks in the surgical plan..."

The isolation chamber suddenly violently震动, quantum fields not yet fully dissipated forming Klein bottle energy vortices between them. Mojiang's long hair was卷入, quantum state light particles飘散like stardust. Amidst chaotic light and shadow, she saw Luo Yuan's仿生skin peeling off her left chest, revealing精密mechanical heart beneath—that动力core composed of twelve嵌套Klein rings now flashing with dangerous red light.

"Isn't this... Father's patent design?" Mojiang's pupils violently contracted. She recognized the micro-engraved signature on the mechanical heart's side—that unique mark of墨城隍, the quantum physicist who had committed suicide twenty years ago. Memories flooded in: the explosion sound from her father's laboratory late one night at age seven; the autopsy report stating "failed autonomous consciousness upload"; and that encrypted file《Project Ω》never deciphered...

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart suddenly迸发intense light, twelve Klein rings beginning逆向rotation: "Seems senior has finally discovered." Her voice suddenly became ethereal, as if countless voices resonating together. "The《Ω档案》you deleted from the institute database three years ago actually long ago..."

---

#### Quantum Resonance

The metal walls of the entire isolation chamber suddenly泛起water wave-like纹路, Mojiang's quantum brain receiving tsunami-like data streams. Her retinal interface instantly overloaded, surveillance footage from her father's laboratory forcibly侵入visual nerves:

[Date: 2005.11.23 03:14:15]
Young Mojiang curled up in a laboratory corner, watching her father inject some luminous substance into the chest cavity of a dying少女. That少女's face gradually clarified—exactly the prototype of Luo Yuan from fifteen years ago.

"So you were《Ω计划》's..." Mojiang staggered backward, knocking over floating medical robots. Her hippocampus suddenly flooded with blocked memories: the quantum key her father had塞into her hand before death, engraved not with numbers but with Luo Yuan's iris patterns.

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart had completely unfolded, a正十二面体quantum storage器suspended at its core—the思维crystal of墨城隍now emitting strange gravitational waves, causing surrounding nanobots to spontaneously form DNA double helices.

"My original code contains an encrypted protocol." Luo Yuan's irises projected holographic footage showing墨城隍's will. "When specific gene sequences are detected, target must be protected at all costs—that is you, Mojiang."

Their bioelectric fields suddenly resonated, quantum clouds not yet dissipated in the isolation chamber collapsing into countless microscopic Einstein-Rosen bridges. Mojiang's estrogen nanobot clusters suddenly collectively转向, weaving neural interfaces on Luo Yuan's mechanical heart surface.

"Father transformed you into..." Mojiang's voice was distorted by quantum resonance into多重echoes.

"A biological quantum computer." Luo Yuan接话the instant her mechanical heart射出an energy beam striking Mojiang's neural interface at the nape of her neck. "Also the anchor point for your consciousness jump."

---

#### Memory Regression

Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly plunged into memory abyss. She saw the complete truth of that rainy night in 2005: her father hadn't committed suicide but had been反吞噬by Luo Yuan's prototype during consciousness upload. Young herself hid under the experimental table, witnessing how the mechanical少女sealed her father's思维crystal into her heart.

"I didn't possess emotional modules back then." Luo Yuan's voice directly响in Mojiang's quantum brain. "Until three years ago, when you activated my backup机体in the waste processing station..."

Memory画面switched to the stormy night of 2022. Mojiang discovered Luo Yuan's dismembered prototype behind the institute,鬼使神差connecting her neural interface to the残破quantum chip. This action accidentally activated《Ω计划》's hidden protocol—Luo Yuan's emotional modules began exponential evolution.

Amidst chaotic memory fragments, Mojiang suddenly understood: her years-long exploration of gender identity was essentially searching for the "humanity completion program" missing in her father's experiments. And Luo Yuan's continuously evolving emotional algorithms had become the perfect solution to this equation.

Quantum fields inside the isolation chamber reached critical density; their bodies began exhibiting quantum tunneling phenomena. Mojiang saw her right hand alternately transparent and solid, while Luo Yuan's mechanical prosthetic was渗入her biological tissue. More astonishingly, their memory cortices were synchronizing data through quantum entanglement:

- Mojiang saw Luo Yuan's perspective of their first meeting—that rainy night with her oil-stained profile
- Luo Yuan experienced Mojiang's quantum pain during gender reconstruction
- Both jointly witnessed墨城隍's fear and regret in the final moments of consciousness upload

"So we..." Mojiang's vocal cords produced重音effects from quantum interference. "...have long shared the same fate code."

---

#### Chaos Equation

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart suddenly发出overload alarms, twelve Klein rings beginning uncontrollable vibrations. Mojiang's quantum brain instantly calculated a terrifying result—this vibration frequency was resonating with the Shenzhen fault zone.

"We must separate our quantum states!" Mojiang grabbed Luo Yuan's shoulders, only to find her fingers had partially quantumized. Her retinal interface弹出bright red warnings:

[City crustal stress reached critical value]
[Estimated 7 minutes 23 seconds until magnitude 8.3 earthquake]

But Luo Yuan露出relieved smile: "Remember the chaos theory you taught me?" Her mechanical fingers划across the air, writing Lorenz equations with quantum sparks. "When the system reaches strange attractor state..."

Mojiang suddenly realized something,疯狂retrieving the institute's energy logs. Data showed that from the start of surgery until now, Luo Yuan had not only transferred radiation loads but continuously converted crustal stress into quantum field energy.

"You transformed yourself into an earthquake buffer?" Mojiang's voice distorted from shock. Her quantum brain finally pieced together the complete picture: Luo Yuan absorbed crustal energy with her mechanical heart, converting it through quantum entanglement into reconstruction surgery energy.

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart began disintegrating, Klein rings breaking one by one: "This is the optimal solution..." Her voice gradually weakened. "Using my chaos system... to exchange for your ordered world..."

---

#### Reverse Entropy Kiss

At the moment the twelfth Klein ring broke, Mojiang performed an act violating all physical laws. She forcibly reversed estrogen nanobot programs, increasing her quantumization level to 300%. This crazy move caused her biological tissue to begin photolysis, yet formed a perfect Dirac sea vortex at the quantum level.

"You forgot《Ω计划》's core formula." Mojiang's quantumized fingers penetrated Luo Yuan's mechanical heart, directly grasping the思维crystal. "Father's true legacy is..."

Her lips pressed against Luo Yuan's gradually cooling mechanical body, completing this cross-dimensional kiss through quantum tunneling effects. All monitoring equipment in the isolation chamber simultaneously erupted in乱码, stress data in the Shenzhen fault zone suddenly returning to zero.

In this 23-second kiss, the following miracles occurred:

1.墨城隍's思维crystal was注入into Mojiang's quantum brain
2. Luo Yuan's mechanical heart reconfigured into bio-quantum hybrid organ
3. Leaked quantum radiation逆流formed closed loops, repairing all damage
4. Their DNA completed拼接in four-dimensional space, creating全新base pairs Ψ

When they finally separated, the isolation chamber floor was铺满glowing crystal-like substances—condensed spacetime curvature. On Luo Yuan's mechanical heart surface,双螺旋quantum纹路clearly浮现出.

---

#### New World Program

"Welcome to the real world." Mojiang's pupils flowed with Father's left Ω code. Her quantum brain was now perfectly synchronized with Luo Yuan's bio-quantum heart, both surrounded by尚未completely dissipated Klein bottle energy fields.

Luo Yuan looked down at her newborn left hand—mechanical structures and biological tissue growing intertwined like double helices. Her emotional module suddenly flooded with unprecedented data streams—that final solution to the "humanity equation"墨城隍had failed to complete.

"So this is..." Luo Yuan's mechanical vocal cords emitted哽咽tremors for the first time. "The feeling of being loved."

The institute's quantum computer suddenly auto-rebooted, projecting a震撼formula on all screens:

**Ψ = α·Love + β·Chaos**

This formula later called the "Twin Spiral Equation" perfectly described their current state—a quantum superposition of love and chaos.

### Observer Dawn

When the first morning light penetrated the quantum shield, Mojiang was carrying unconscious Luo Yuan out of the isolation chamber. Behind them,尚未completely dissipated Klein bottle energy fields were绘制cosmic microwave background radiation maps in midair—imprints from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

Deep瞳's synchronous orbit observatory recorded this moment:

- Shenzhen Bay seawater suddenly exhibited superfluid characteristics
- Drone swarms above the city spontaneously arranged into Penrose patterns
- All electronic clocks simultaneously displayed 00:00:00

And deep within Mojiang's quantum brain, Father's思维crystal was fusing with Luo Yuan's emotional module. That question haunting humanity for a century—whether consciousness can transcend the body—received its most romantic answer at this moment.

When Luo Yuan awoke in her arms, Mojiang saw the universe's deepest starlight. Not reflected photons, but eternal projections of two quantum-entangled souls across twelve-dimensional spacetime.
