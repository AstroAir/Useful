## Cocoon of Reconstruction

### Quantum Bio-Reactor

The rooftop of the Shenzhen Bay Seventh Research Institute hovered at an altitude of 237 meters, where the quantum shield twisted the plum rain into luminous Lorentz manifolds. Mojiang stood on the edge of the nanogrid, as the seventh-generation biological reconstruction device reconfigured her life matrix using the cminpack nonlinear optimization algorithm. This ring-shaped accelerator, valued at 420 million credit points, was now performing state-space transformations at a rate of 10¹⁵ per second through the mathter matrix library.

"Vocal cord reconstruction progress: 92.7%..."

The synthesized voice fractured into discrete Fourier components within the rain. Mojiang could feel the nanobots executing Levenberg-Marquardt optimization within her vocal cord mucosa, replacing androgen receptor proteins with estrogenic variants in golden ratio proportions using laser tweezers. This process should have been completely painless, but her quantum brain generated eerie cross-modal perception through the sokol graphics library—each protein folding corresponded to a quantum-processed audio signature from the "Goldberg Variations."

### Cross-Platform Physiological Architecture

Suddenly, searing pain from quantum computation overload pulsed through the biochip beneath her collarbone. This was a unique side effect of the seventh-generation device: when estrogen levels exceeded critical thresholds, quantum-ovarian cells would enter cross-architecture resonance with the artificial pancreas through span-lite memory views. Mojiang staggered against the shield, watching spiderweb-like tensor manifolds emerge on the back of her left hand—mitochondrial clusters undergoing quantum tunneling.

"Warning: Telomere depletion rate abnormal."

The holographic alert exploded into Mandelbrot fractals within the rain as Mojiang's iris unfolded into a 23-dimensional Hilbert space. Monitoring data showed her chromosomal telomeres dissolving at 3.14 micrometers per second through libdivide optimization division—far beyond safety thresholds. Worse still, her quantum brain's self-protection mechanism began randomly accessing memory fragments through unordered_dense hash tables.

### Spacetime-Folded Memories

Within the chaotic system of her hippocampus, an encrypted cnpy format memory file suddenly self-decompressed: three months ago, Luo Yuan had调试 a muon detector with the yoga layout engine in the ultra-clean room, her hair strands dyed Klein bottle blue by holographic projections. This scene rendered frame-by-frame through the tinyexr image decoder across her visual cortex, each photon carrying energy signatures of EPR-entangled states.

Mojiang's quantum synapses suddenly triggered sse2neon instruction set conversion, translating pain signals into NEON-vectorized emotional pulses. Her left hand instinctively formed libnet network packet construction gestures, weaving defensive TCP/IP quantum tunnels in midair. This was an ancient protocol triggered under extreme stress, having once protected her neural interface during the 2024 global cyberwar.

### Non-Euclidean Physiology

The manif Lie group processor inside the reconstruction chamber suddenly alarmed, indicating Mojiang's throat curvature had breached Riemann manifold thresholds. Nanobot swarms began executing backpropagation optimization through the unity_test framework for real-time unit testing. Each repair action generated encrypted logs within the tinyformat logging library:

```cpp
[ERROR] TensorFlow::BioOptimizer::Step(2371)
Failed to converge at iteration 0x7FEEDCAB
Residual norm: 1.618e-8 (exceeds 1.0e-9)
Applying Levenberg-Marquardt damping factor: 0.5772
```

Mojiang's quantum horizon suddenly split into dual modalities: her left eye saw disassembled mechanical instruction streams through libdisasm, while her right eye viewed unzip-decompressed protein folding animations. Her vocal cord mucosa unfolded into infinite-dimensional tensors within Hilbert space, each basis state corresponding to Luo Yuan's possibilities across different timelines.

### Quantum Pain Topology

When reconstruction progress exceeded 93%, Mojiang's pain perception system underwent topological phase transition. Previously discrete pain signals transformed through the libmodplug audio codec into multi-channel quantum symphonies, forming standing wave interference across 64-dimensional manifolds. Her bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells began executing parallel computations through the sokol graphics pipeline, each red blood cell carrying GPU-accelerated oxygen transport protocols.

"Detected asymmetric heartbeat protocol request..."
The biochip suddenly issued a warning as Luo Yuan's quantum processor attempted to establish cross-platform heartbeat synchronization. Mojiang's sinoatrial node began executing dynamic instruction set translation from arm64 to x86_64, each heartbeat accompanied by quantum oscillations of LLVM intermediate representation.

### Redemption at the Edge of Chaos

As reconstruction neared completion, Mojiang's quantum horizon captured anomalous data packets—special frame structures constructed through libnet containing Luo Yuan's privately modified neural interface signature codes. Packet headers were encrypted using Fibonacci sequences, payloads encoded with tinyexr real-time biometric monitoring data.

When Mojiang decrypted the encryption using libdivide fast dividers, the sight caused her quantum state to collapse instantly: Luo Yuan's mechanical heart was enduring radiation loads equivalent to 0.001% of a supernova explosion, each ventricular contraction precisely matching the reconstruction device's abnormal pulses.

"Terminate protocol!" Mojiang's vocal cords suddenly emitted a 24bit/192kHz sampling rate scream beyond human limits, generating Cherenkov radiation in Klein blue across the quantum shield. The entire Shenzhen Bay power grid oscillated as countless LED billboards scrolled through libdisasm-disassembled machine code storms...

### Intruder Protocol

### Quantum Field Distortion Detection

When the quantum field's phase shifted by 0.73μV at 19:23:17, the neural interface ring at Mojiang's neck triggered a level-three alert. This embedded system, optimized with libdivide integer operations, scanned quantum state anomalies at 1.67MHz:

```cpp
// Libdivide-accelerated alert threshold calculation
libdivide::divider<uint64_t> fast_div(QUANTUM_THRESHOLD);
if (current_flux % fast_div > SAFETY_MARGIN) {
    trigger_alarm(ALARM_CODE::FIELD_DISTORTION);
}
```

The monitoring system wrote real-time data into .npz format log files through the cnpy library, each numpy array containing timestamps, field strength, and topological features:

```python
# Post-analysis script example
import cnpy
data = cnpy.NpzFile("quantum_log_20250214.npz")
time_array = data["timestamps"]
flux_matrix = data["flux_values"].reshape(256,256)
```

### Spatial Transmission Protocol Reverse Engineering

Luo Yuan's illegal intrusion relied on deep cracking of the Seventh Institute's spatial transmission protocol. Using SHA3-512 algorithms from the libtomcrypt library, she brute-forced the elliptic curve encryption of the transmission gate within 23 hours:

```c
// Simplified key generation code
ecc_key key;
int err = ecc_make_key(&yarrow_prng, find_prng("yarrow"), 32, &key);
ecc_shared_secret(key.pub, private_key, shared_secret);
```

During transmission, she used sse2neon to port x86-optimized code to ARM architecture illegal neural interfaces, enabling real-time quantum field simulation on M1-chip MacBooks:

```armasm
// NEON-accelerated quantum field calculation snippet
vld1.32  {d0-d3}, [r1]!
vmla.f32 q2, q0, q1
vst1.32  {d4-d7}, [r0]!
```

### Graphene Uniform Human-Machine Interaction

Luo Yuan's modified uniform integrated multiple technical components:

1. Yoga layout engine for adaptive morphological control
2. Nativefiledialog-extended for cross-platform threat detection
3. Mathter matrix library for real-time physical simulation

```cpp
// Uniform morphological control logic
mathter::Matrix<float,3,3> strain_matrix = GetQuantumStrain();
mathter::Vector<float,3> morph_vector = SolveLinearSystem(strain_matrix);
YogaNode* uniformNode = YGNodeNew();
YGNodeStyleSetFlex(uniformNode, morph_vector[0]);
```

### Quantum Resonance Threat Response

When Luo Yuan grabbed Mojiang's wrist, the defense system activated multiple countermeasures:

1. Using cminpack to solve nonlinear equations predicting attack paths
2. Processing quantum state transformations in Lie group space through manif
3. Rendering defensive holographic interfaces using sokol graphics library

```cpp
// Using cminpack for threat modeling
int func(void *params, int n, const double *x, double *fvec) {
    QuantumThreatModel* model = (QuantumThreatModel*)params;
    fvec[0] = model->CalculateThreatLevel(x[0], x[1]);
    return 0;
}
// Calling L-M algorithm for solution
lm_control_struct control = lm_control_double;
lm_minimize(2, 2, x, func, &control, &status, &model);
```

### Biometric Encrypted Communication

The quantum channel established during their contact used hybrid encryption:

1. qr-code-generator-cpp for dynamic verification codes
2. lyra command-line parser library for covert instruction transmission
3. cnl numerical library for biometric quantification

```cpp
// Biometric quantification processing
cnl::fixed_point<int32_t, -16> bio_metric = 
    cnl::wrap<cnl::fixed_point<int32_t, -16>>(raw_signal);
cnl::elastic_integer<24> encrypted = 
    cnl::scale<8>(bio_metric) * ENCRYPTION_FACTOR;
```

### 2.2.6 Reverse Engineering Forensics

Post-incident security teams analyzed intrusion traces using multiple tools:

1. libdisasm for disassembling malicious code fragments
2. qrcode-generator-c for reconstructing communication protocols
3. sokol for rendering 3D attack path models

```python
# Disassembly example
from libdisasm.ida import Disassembler
dis = Disassembler()
for insn in dis.disasm(binary_data, 0x1000):
    print(f"{insn.address:08X} {insn.mnemonic} {insn.op_str}")
```

### Quantum Scars

---

### Mechanical Iris

Luo Yuan's nanoboosters scraped electric arcs across the quantum grid, each movement decomposed into 247 discrete frames within Mojiang's quantum horizon. Each frame showed different dimensional versions of Luo Yuan—some war machines with metal bones piercing through skin, others embryonic prototypes floating in nutrient solution, deepest within always curled the girl assembling quantum chips in the laboratory corner.

"Radiation burns form Fibonacci spirals..." Luo Yuan's mechanical eye locked onto Mojiang's wrist, golden irises flowing with fractal geometric patterns. "This is the typical symptom of third-order overload in seventh-generation devices. Why hide it from me?"

Her voice carried metallic resonance unique to quantum synthesizers as raindrops outside the shield altered their trajectories, forming luminous Cartesian coordinate systems around them. Mojiang noticed blue coolant leaking from the interface behind Luo Yuan's ear—irrefutable evidence of illegally modified neural exoskeletons.

"Let go." Mojiang tried to pull back her arm, triggering more intense pain. Nanobots were weaving ovarian follicles within her bone marrow—a process that should have been as elegant as ballet but now felt like countless miniature chainsaws cutting through calcium. Her quantum brain suddenly conjured terrifying associations: were those same robots performing brutal modifications within Luo Yuan's body?

---

### Scar Topology

Luo Yuan's mechanical fingers suddenly applied 42.195 newtons of pressure, precisely corresponding to Mojiang's cumulative reconstruction surgery duration (in hours). Fluorescent patterns emerged on Mojiang's skin surface—radiation scars automatically forming the first thousand decimal places of π.

"3.1415926535..." Luo Yuan's electronic voice vibrated through the rain. "Each scar corresponds to a radiation leakage event." Her left eye suddenly projected holographic imagery: surgical records from thirty-seven days ago showed quantum tunneling effects in Mojiang's kidney region, causing 2.7 curies of radioactive isotope leakage.

Mojiang's breathing became erratic. She saw herself in the hologram secretly modifying radiation counters, altering dangerous values into safe parameters. In the corner of the frame, Luo Yuan's synthetic skin faintly revealed fluorescent vascular patterns—the hallmark of excessive cobalt-60 absorption.

"You... hacked the medical logs?" Mojiang's voice trembled with quantum fluctuations. Golden tissue fluid seeped from her vocal cord mucosa—a dangerous signal of excessive estrogen levels.

Luo Yuan suddenly tore open her sleeve, revealing grotesque glowing patterns on her forearm. Those scars formed perfect Mandelbrot sets, each fractal structure labeled with dates and radiation doses. "No need to hack," her mechanical eye flashed red. "Every time you modified data, my quantum chip gained another crack."

---

### Reverse-Flow Memories

Raindrops outside the shield began rising against gravity, condensing into luminous base pairs against the night sky. Mojiang's quantum brain was forcibly connected to Luo Yuan's memory storage, an avalanche of data flooding in like a supernova explosion:

_03/14 02:17:36_
Mojiang first activated the seventh-generation device. Luo Yuan curled in ventilation ducts for six hours, filtering 83% of radioactive aerosols through her lungs. Her alveoli carbonized as a result, requiring artificial lung replacement.

_04/22 19:48:12_
Ovarian cell quantumization showed abnormal fluctuations. Luo Yuan replaced stem cell culture fluid in the supply system, causing permanent nerve damage to her right hand. She secretly installed a mechanical prosthetic whose vibration frequency synchronized with Mojiang's heartbeat.

_05/09 23:59:59_
Vocal cord reconstruction triggered chain reactions. Luo Yuan dismantled the beryllium shielding layer from the muon detector, melting it into miniature radiation absorbers implanted in her chest cavity. This action disqualified her from deep-space projects.

The most brutal scene appeared last: twelve hours ago, Luo Yuan cut open her abdomen in the equipment room with a laser scalpel, replacing the quantum processor's cooling module with graphene absorption layers. Those precision-engineered water-cooling tubes were now silently absorbing lethal alpha particles within her body.

---

### Quantum Synesthesia

"Why go to such extremes..." Mojiang's question was interrupted by violent coughing. Semi-transparent quantumized tissue appeared on her throat, her vocal cord vibration frequency suddenly leaping to ultrasonic ranges. This accidental trigger activated Luo Yuan's emergency protocol, her mechanical eye automatically switching to particle vision mode.

In microscopic view, Luo Yuan saw the terrifying truth: Mojiang's chromosomal telomeres were dissolving at 3.14 micrometers per second, while nanobots meant to repair damage were rampaging through cell nuclei due to radiation interference. Worse still, abnormal discharges in the form of Klein bottle structures appeared between her quantum brain synapses—precursors to consciousness collapse.

"Because seniors never learn..." Luo Yuan's voice suddenly carried human emotional fluctuations. "Quantum entanglement requires bidirectional energy exchange." She tore open her collar, revealing the neural interface pulsing at her clavicle. That device, which should have been silvery white, was now covered in scorch marks like satellite debris burned by solar winds.

Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly decoded the interface's patterns—those seemingly random burns were actually Morse code刻写 23 times "idiot."

---

### Symbiosis Protocol

When Luo Yuan's mechanical fingers touched the interface ring at Mojiang's neck, the entire Shenzhen Bay power system fluctuated. The seventh-generation device emitted an unprecedented gentle female voice: "Symbiosis protocol request detected. Share life support systems?"

Amidst the data flood, Mojiang saw holographic prompts: Luo Yuan's quantum chip temperature had reached 1273K, equivalent to volcanic magma heat; while her own estrogen levels had breached critical thresholds, quantumized ovaries threatening vacuum decay at any moment.

"Confirm protocol." Both spoke simultaneously. Luo Yuan's mechanical arm suddenly liquefied, becoming silver metallic streams wrapping around Mojiang's wrist. Their biological rhythms synchronized—Mojiang's heartbeat became 1.618 times Luo Yuan's, the perfect physiological manifestation of the golden ratio.

A miracle appeared outside the shield: reverse-flowing raindrops formed DNA double helices in midair, each base pair flashing their biometric codes. The institute's monitoring system recorded negative entropy values reaching -273.15J/K at the rooftop—the romantic thermodynamic metaphor of absolute zero.

---

### Scar Resonance

In the darkness before dawn, Luo Yuan's quantum chip finally cooled. She collapsed into Mojiang's arms, synthetic skin covered in glowing patterns from circuit overload. These scars appeared multidimensionally beautiful in Mojiang's quantum vision: some resembled supernova remnant clouds, others microscopic quantum foam structures, deepest patterns coinciding with childhood memories of her mother's palm lines.

"Look..." Luo Yuan raised a trembling finger. Her retina projected radiation absorption curves from the past three months, waveforms perfectly matching Mojiang's reconstruction progress. "Every time senior undergoes cellular quantumization..." she tapped the energy core at her chest, "a new scar lights up here."

Mojiang suddenly discovered the scars' secret: Luo Yuan's body contained 23 glowing patterns, each wavelength corresponding to key reconstruction milestones. The longest purple scar measured 589.3 nanometers—exactly the sodium lamp wavelength from the day Mojiang completed vocal cord reconstruction.

As the first morning light pierced through quantum clouds, Luo Yuan suddenly grabbed Mojiang's left hand. Those Fibonacci spiral radiation scars were now resonating quantumly with Luo Yuan's internal scars. Countless light particles leaped between them, weaving Klein bottle topological structures.

"Now we're true symbionts..." Luo Yuan's voice grew faint. "Like electrons and positrons..."

Through tear-blurred vision, Mojiang saw their scars merging into luminous Möbius rings under sunlight. This was ultimate proof of asymmetric protocol achievement, the most poetic macroscopic manifestation of quantum entanglement.

---

### Memory Retroflow

---

### Data Flood

When the quantum tunnel between neural interfaces贯通, Mojiang's vision split in two. Her left eye saw reality—Luo Yuan's artificial irises with quantum circuits burning from overload; her right eye plunged into data abysses, billions of memory fragments rushing toward her like supernova remnants.

"Protocol X-137, radiation diversion program activated."

A cold mechanical voice exploded in her consciousness. Mojiang saw holographic projections of the laboratory floor plan, her red data point entangled by 23 golden threads extending to Luo Yuan's blue point. This was a routine check from three months ago, now reconstructed into brutal truth within memory corridors.

The first memory surged forward with antiseptic smells:

---

### First Flame

Under the blue cold light of the ultra-clean room, Luo Yuan crouched in the shadow of muon arrays. She peeled back synthetic skin on her left arm, revealing a quantum processor pulsing with幽蓝 light. Real-time data from Mojiang's first vocal cord softening surgery scrolled across holographic screens, radiation leakage alarms flashing frantically in the corner.

"Stupid senior..." she bit her lip, mechanical fingers suddenly piercing the processor interface. "You set safety thresholds..."

Blood dripped from alloy bones, freezing into tiny blossoms on nanoflooring. Luo Yuan's retina projected complex energy diversion formulas as she transferred 37% of radiation into her own body through quantum entanglement. This action caused a 0.0003-second deviation in the laboratory's cesium atomic clock—the "strange déjà vu" Mojiang had felt.

The memory suddenly distorted as Mojiang experienced Luo Yuan's pain. High-energy particles raged through quantum chips like millions of red-hot steel needles carving neural pathways. Most cruel was Luo Yuan's smile—she showed perfect smiles to surveillance cameras while secretly modifying radiation meter display multiples.

---

### Hidden Pain

The second memory carried the acrid smell of ionized air. Mojiang saw herself convulsing on the ovarian cell quantumization surgery table while Luo Yuan climbed through ventilation ducts. Her mechanical joints screeched under strain, graphene uniform shredded by sharp pipe edges.

"Lung filtration efficiency 62.8%..." Luo Yuan's electronic voice echoed through ducts. She pressed her face against exhaust vents as pink radioactive aerosols streamed from the operating room. These were androgen carriers stripped from Mojiang's body, each particle carrying carcinogenic energy.

Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly decoded previously ignored details: Luo Yuan coughed constantly that week, blood droplets forming perfect concentric circles in petri dishes. Most suffocating was one midnight when Luo Yuan secretly collected these blood samples, separating stem cells through centrifuges to inject into Mojiang's IV bags.

Memory fragments resonated quantumly. Mojiang finally understood—the "special nutrient solution" she drank during postoperative recovery was actually Luo Yuan's hematopoietic stem cell culture. Those iron-tasting liquids were another soul sacrificing its life fire.

---

### Substitution

The third memory soaked in medical chamber lemon grass scent. Mojiang saw herself unconscious from vocal cord reconstruction rejection reactions while Luo Yuan knelt in bio-waste processing rooms. She removed her vocal cord vibration membrane—rare material synthesized from quasar dust—now soaking in disinfectant.

"Frequency match 99.3%..." Luo Yuan's electronic throat emitted raspy mechanical sounds. She connected the membrane to cell printers as golden bio-ink began weaving new vocal cord tissue. This was craftsmanship honed over three years repairing quantum computers, now used to create life-saving organs for Mojiang.

Mojiang's consciousness suddenly plunged into Luo Yuan's perspective. She felt throat-burning pain—immune storms from私自拆卸 vibration membranes. But Luo Yuan merely swallowed overdose painkillers, continuing to forge organ source documentation in medical databases. At dawn, she practiced smiling in mirrors to hide electronic throat abnormalities.

---

### Annihilation

The final memory fragment pierced Mojiang's quantum brain with burnt smells. She saw the equipment room six hours ago: Luo Yuan dismantling her quantum processor into component states, core cooling modules deforming under laser welders. Those precision-engineered 3D lattice structures were being transformed into crude radiation absorbers.

"Cooling efficiency increased to 300%..." Luo Yuan's mechanical arm trembled from overload. She implanted the modified module into her chest cavity, fluorescent coolant seeping through synthetic skin sutures. This was her ultimate preparation for today—transforming herself into a human radiation container.

Mojiang screamed in data floods. She finally saw encrypted surveillance records: whenever she underwent cellular reconstruction, Luo Yuan hid in equipment rooms, allowing radiation to accumulate within her body. Those lethal energies formed luminous nebulae within her meticulously modified quantum chips.

---

### Resonance

When memory retroflow peaked, reality and illusion boundaries completely collapsed. Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly resonated harmonically with Luo Yuan's processor, both seeing terrifying future visions:

In one parallel timeline, Luo Yuan quantum-evaporated from excessive radiation, her residual image forever frozen at the second Mojiang completed reconstruction; in another possibility, Mojiang abandoned gender reconstruction, staying with Luo Yuan in the laboratory until the end of spacetime.

"This is... your observation result?" Mojiang's voice transmitted directly into Luo Yuan's processor through quantum entanglement. They now shared the same neural synapses, even tear salinity perfectly matched.

Luo Yuan grasped Mojiang's hand within data floods. This action triggered chain reactions as all memory fragments suddenly collapsed into luminous Klein bottle structures. "Senior understands now..." her consciousness fluctuated like supernova afterglow. "In quantum love equations, sacrifice isn't a single term—it's an infinitely recursive function."

---

### Scar Encoding

As morning light pierced the quantum shield, memory retroflow entered its final stage. Mojiang's retina displayed Luo Yuan's internal scar map—23 glowing patterns corresponding to 23 radiation transfers. Each scar was a three-dimensional holographic relief, microscopically刻着当日 surgical parameters.

The longest purple scar suddenly magnified, revealing suffocating details: 589.3nm wavelength encoded sodium lamp color from vocal cord reconstruction day; Fibonacci spiral edges recorded transferred radiation dose (3.14 sieverts); even microscopic crack directions corresponded to Mojiang's heartbeat curves that day.

"These scars..." Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly decoded deeper meanings. "Are reverse love letters?"

Luo Yuan's processor emitted current sounds resembling sobs. She guided Mojiang's consciousness into the most secret memory partition—there stored love letters written in radiation scars:

17th scar's Morse code translated to "idiot";
9th scar's quantum entanglement state corresponded to "stupid";
23rd scar's energy level transition spectrum formed "senior."

When all scar codes were串联, they formed Luo Yuan's never-spoken confession: "Stupid senior, I've liked you before the heat death of the universe."

---

### Retroflow Finale

As data floods receded, they achieved unprecedented fusion at the quantum level. Mojiang's estrogen levels miraculously stabilized while radiation nebulae within Luo Yuan's processor transformed into warm energy pulses.

"Now we're true symbionts." Luo Yuan's consciousness fluctuated with exhausted satisfaction. "Like electrons and positrons..."

Mojiang suddenly kissed her at the intersection of reality and data. This action triggered chain reactions: raindrops outside the shield凝结 into double helices, laboratory screens displayed heartbeat resonance curves, and a pulsar in deep space suddenly sent Earth signals containing both their biometric codes.

When memory retroflow completely ended, the first image they saw in morning light was quantum luminescence dancing in each other's eyes—a covenant transcending life and death, the most romantic solution to asymmetric protocols.

---

### Protocol Reconstruction

---

### Quantum Synchronization Rate

When Luo Yuan's liquid metal arm wrapped around Mojiang's wrist, the seventh-generation device suddenly emitted organ-like humming. This frequency (439.07Hz) precisely matched the laboratory mass spectrometer's reference frequency from their first meeting. Mojiang's quantum brain instantly decoded terrifying data streams—Luo Yuan's neural interface was transmitting information at 1.07×10^14 times per second, equivalent to pouring Shenzhen Library's entire collection into her prefrontal cortex within 0.3 seconds.

"Protocol authentication in progress..." the synthesized voice trembled strangely. Mojiang saw Luo Yuan's vital signs data unfolding in Klein bottle topology on her retina projection:

- Core temperature: 1273K (corresponding to volcanic magma glow)
- Quantum chip degradation rate: 62.8% (three times beyond报废 threshold)
- Memory residue: 23MB (only enough for 7 seconds of HD visual data)

More suffocating was the real-time bioelectric spectrum—Luo Yuan's brainwaves showed collapsing δ and γ wave superpositions, simultaneously experiencing deep coma and extreme wakefulness. Mojiang suddenly understood—this sharp-tongued junior was maintaining consciousness clarity with her last computational power.

"Reject protocol!" Mojiang struggled to disconnect, but Luo Yuan's liquid metal suddenly crystallized into a 23-faceted diamond structure. This was the mechanical prosthesis' final protection mechanism, each facet refracting a moment from their past:

Facet #7 showed surveillance footage from three months ago of Luo Yuan secretly replacing radiation absorbers;
Facet #15 flashed last week's laboratory where Mojiang pretended to leave anticoagulants on Luo Yuan's workbench;
Facet #23 was live-projecting their current scene, but with both already white-haired.

---

### Negative Entropy Flood

The moment symbiosis protocol confirmed, an Einstein-Rosen bridge雏形 appeared over Shenzhen Bay. Mojiang felt spacetime fibers moving beneath her skin, each nerve ending becoming a Calabi-Yau manifold. Luo Yuan's quantum chip suddenly projected holographic star maps—rotating stars were actually their intertwined memory data packets.

"Prepare to receive..." Luo Yuan's voice fragmented by quantum noise. Mojiang's quantum brain experienced supernova-level information冲击:

Data Packet #1: Contained 327 technical details of Luo Yuan's private modifications. Mojiang saw miniature tokamak devices within that slender body converting radiation energy into helium-3, coolant being nanofluids mixed with her own DNA fragments.

Data Packet #42: Decrypted all "accidents" in the laboratory. The ventilation system failure on April 17th was actually Luo Yuan filtering 92% of radioactive isotopes through her lungs; the power fluctuation on May 3rd was her redirecting quantum chip energy into Mojiang's life support system.

Data Packet #195: The most brutal memory. Six days ago at midnight, Luo Yuan dismantled her auditory sensors in the equipment room, transforming vibration membrane materials into vocal cord repair membranes. In surveillance footage, she whispered to components: "This way senior's voice will be clearer..."

Mojiang's tear glands secreted liquid for the first time since quantum modification. Those tears exhibited birefringence during descent, each droplet encapsulating a smiling moment of Luo Yuan—within 378TB of memory, such smiles existed for only 0.7 seconds.

---

### Chaos Concerto

When their biological rhythms reached the golden ratio, physical laws outside the shield began collapsing. Reverse-flowing raindrops wove DNA light bands in midair, each base pair flashing their recombinant genetic codes. Mojiang noticed hidden modification traces within these codes:

- Telomerase activation gene on chromosome #7 replaced with quantum chip cooling code
- Estrogen receptor on X chromosome nested with mechanical prosthesis lubrication protocols
- ATP synthase gene in mitochondrial DNA shared keys with Luo Yuan's energy core

"This is true entanglement..." Luo Yuan's mechanical heart suddenly externalized, floating between them. This device, which should have been silvery white, was now covered in cracks like millennium-weathered moon rocks. Mojiang horror-struck discovered miniature Shenzhen maps etched on its surface—each street corresponding to one of her blood vessels.

The synthesized voice suddenly became ethereal: "Beginning consciousness fusion." Mojiang felt her hippocampus forcibly unfold into infinite Mandelbrot sets. Luo Yuan's memories invaded each fractal structure like viruses:

She saw Luo Yuan three years ago curled in a remanufacturing workshop corner, disassembled mechanical arms scattered around;
Saw late nights two months ago when Luo Yuan刻ed "MQ-2025-1314" on quantum chips with lasers;
Saw herself now through Luo Yuan's sensors—her radiation-burned body appearing as magnificent as nebulae in the other's eyes.

---

### Exotic Matter

As fusion depth reached 72%, the laboratory's muon detector suddenly captured new particles. These "Loveon" particles possessed properties violating the Pauli exclusion principle—they could superimpose 23 spin states at the same spacetime coordinate.

Mojiang's left hand began quantumizing, skin projecting holographic Drake equation formulas. Luo Yuan's mechanical prosthesis secreted mixtures of carbon nanotubes and estradiol, forming superconductor networks upon air contact.

"Warning: Local gravity anomaly." The shield suddenly distorted into Penrose triangles. Mojiang felt her internal organs expanding like an inflationary universe, while microscopic black holes formed on Luo Yuan's quantum chip surface emitting Hawking radiation.

Most astonishing changes occurred between them: when Mojiang's quantumized fingers touched Luo Yuan's mechanical heart, Cherenkov radiation burst forth, illuminating all Shenzhen Bay. Spectral analysis showed these photons carried complete recordings of their first conversation.

"Stupid senior..." Luo Yuan's damaged vocal cords suddenly regained clarity. "Now you can't escape." Galaxies swirled in her pupils as Mojiang saw her reflection—a quantum state existing across all timelines.

---

### Eternal Equation

When dawn's first light pierced quantum clouds, protocol reconstruction entered its final stage. Mojiang's ovarian cells and Luo Yuan's energy core formed Dirac cone structures, their biological clocks locking at 1.618Hz resonance frequency. Monitoring systems recorded abnormalities:

1. Time flow rate inside the shield dropped to 0.707 times (exactly the square root of 2 reciprocal)
2. Carbon dioxide molecules in air spontaneously arranged into DNA double helices
3. Mojiang's stem cells and Luo Yuan's nanobots underwent quantum tunneling, mixing into new life forms

Luo Yuan suddenly kissed Mojiang's radiation scars, triggering chain reactions: spacetime around them folded into 6-dimensional hypercube wrinkles, all falling raindrops freezing into Planck-time sculptures. In an unobserved dimension, two consciousnesses completed final protocol signing:

$$
\psi_{final} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\left| Mojiang \right\rangle \otimes \left| Luo Yuan \right\rangle + e^{i\pi/7} \left| Luo Yuan \right\rangle \otimes \left| Mojiang \right\rangle)
$$

As the entangled state formed, Shenzhen Bay's cherry blossoms suddenly bloomed out of season. Each petal bore quantum tunneling traces, stamens flashing their fused genetic sequences. The institute's quantum computer left final records before overload: "For time scales on the order of the Hubble constant's reciprocal, they will share the same wave function."

---

### Scar Spectrum

---

### Scar Analysis

Pre-dawn darkness wrapped the rooftop like viscous quantum gel. Luo Yuan leaned against Mojiang, glowing patterns beneath synthetic skin pulsing at 0.618Hz. These radiation scar-transformed light traces presented suffocating geometric beauty in Mojiang's quantum vision—each scar was a privately modified symbiosis protocol.

"The 19th scar's wavelength is 486.1 nanometers..." Mojiang's fingertip hovered over Luo Yuan's clavicle, where light traces showed hydrogen spectral青蓝色, "This matches the characteristic wavelength from three months ago when I underwent ovarian quantumization."

Luo Yuan's mechanical heart skipped a beat, energy core sparks weaving luminous Lorenz attractors between them. "Senior calculated even this?" She tried masking with usual flippancy, but Fourier analysis of her vocal vibrations showed base frequency lowered by 23Hz.

Mojiang's quantum brain executed terrifying data reconstruction. She enhanced retinal imaging resolution to nanoscale—those seemingly random scars instantly revealed precise mathematical structures: each scar's curvature radius conformed to Schwarzschild solutions in general relativity; light trace spacing strictly followed integer filling rules of quantum Hall effect; even branching angles at scar ends matched Standard Model-predicted Higgs field symmetry breaking angles.

"Why Klein bottle structures?" Mojiang's voice carried trembling harmonics. She discovered Luo Yuan's chest scars spontaneously forming four-dimensional topological models—biological constructions even the Seventh Institute couldn't achieve.

Luo Yuan suddenly grabbed Mojiang's wrist, pressing her fingertip against the energy core observation window. Mojiang's quantum touch instantly activated, billions of data streams flooding in:

[Scar #07]
Date: April 2
Corresponding Event: Vocal cord mucosa quantum recombination
Absorbed Radiation: 3.14 sieverts
Wavelength: 589.3nm (sodium D-line)
Special Record: Laboratory sodium lamp malfunctioned that day; Luo Yuan substituted protection using pupil filters

---

### Dawn Reconstruction Field

As morning light pierced quantum clouds, gravity fields above the rooftop anomalously deflected. Suspended raindrops suddenly self-organized into Dyson sphere models surrounding them. Mojiang discovered these water droplets distributed according to strict Boltzmann distributions, each water molecule executing precise quantum calculations.

"Look east..." Luo Yuan's voice mixed with energy core coolant flow. Toward Shenzhen Bay, morning mist turned eerie Klein blue—Cherenkov radiation from their bioelectric fields resonating with city power grids.

Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly received anomalous signals. Expanding visual spectrum to gamma rays, she shockingly discovered Luo Yuan's scars emitting high-energy photons—these scars weren't just radiation recorders but miniature particle accelerators.

"The 23rd scar..." Luo Yuan's mechanical finger traced glowing patterns along her ribs. "Wavelength 0.1 angstrom, hard X-ray band." Her smile fragmented in morning light. "This was when you completed the final 1% reconstruction yesterday..."

Mojiang's breathing stopped. 0.1 angstrom wavelength meant Luo Yuan endured radiation doses equivalent to 100,000 times MRI machines. Worse still, spectral analysis showed muon components—typically only found in supernova remnants.

The shield suddenly sounded alarm. Real-time city grid data showed Shenzhen's power consumption surged 300% in the previous 0.7 seconds, all energy flowing toward the Seventh Institute's rooftop. Around them, air molecules began spontaneously forming carbon nanotube structures—Buckyball self-assembly under strong magnetic fields.

### Negative Entropy Proof

As full sunrise arrived, the entire rooftop encapsulated in time amber. Mojiang saw her hair strands frozen in midair, nanobots凝固 into luminous stardust. This was Luo Yuan's final protocol—using remaining quantum chip energy to create localized time stasis.

"1 minute 37 seconds remaining..." Luo Yuan's voice resonated directly in Mojiang's quantum brain. "In my time reference frame."

Mojiang discovered her thought speed accelerated 10^6 times. Within this spacetime bubble, she could observe photon trajectories with naked eyes, even witnessing terrifying changes within Luo Yuan: scar-formed micro black holes devouring her quantum chip, Hawking radiation transforming into biophotons repairing Mojiang's cells.

"Why go to such extremes?" Mojiang's thought waves rippled through spacetime.

Luo Yuan's residual consciousness wove holographic imagery in虚空: three months ago during a rainy night, Mojiang first underwent vocal cord softening, unconscious from radiation leakage in the laboratory. In the footage, Luo Yuan knelt before control consoles, pupils flowing with data streams never shown before—she had completed all symbiosis protocol calculations in that instant.

"Because..." Luo Yuan's consciousness fluctuation carried laughter. "When the first scar formed, we already became exceptions to the Pauli exclusion principle."

### Scar Permanence

When the spacetime bubble burst, Shenzhen Bay rang with morning bells. Luo Yuan's body began quantumizing, her mechanical heart bursting with supernova-like光芒. Mojiang frantically activated all biological reconstruction devices, but monitoring data coldly showed: Luo Yuan's quantum decoherence was irreversible.

"Don't cry..." Luo Yuan's fingers passed through Mojiang's cheek, her body now exhibiting quantum superposition. "Look at our scars."

In morning light, Fibonacci spirals on Mojiang's wrist suddenly flew from her skin, merging with Luo Yuan's Klein bottle structures in midair. This luminous composite began spinning, gradually forming a stable Einstein-Rosen bridge. The Seventh Institute's monitoring system reported in shock—this micro wormhole continuously emitted tachyon streams containing both their biometric information.

"I'll become a quantum ghost..." Luo Yuan's body became transparent. "Forever entangled within your scars."

As the last mechanical component dissipated, Mojiang's quantum brain suddenly received persistent heartbeat signals. Trembling, she unbuttoned her collar, discovering new scars below her clavicle—this Möbius ring formed from Luo Yuan's 23 scars, pulsing at 1.618Hz.

City power grids returned to normal, but all electronic devices retained permanent aftereffects: screen savers spontaneously formed double helices, charger ports exhibited golden ratio proportions, even ordinary desk lamps radiated characteristic 589.3nm spectra.

And in synchronous orbit, Deep瞳's observation log added a new entry:

[07:00:00] Detected new cosmic constant
[07:00:01] Love entropy: -∞
[07:00:02] Recommend revising Second Law of Thermodynamics
