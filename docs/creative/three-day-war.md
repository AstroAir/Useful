# **Ink-Stained Dust: The Three-Day War**

## **Volume I: Gathering Storms**

### **Chapter 1: Imperial Mysteries**

At the top of the Central Tower in the Imperial Capital, Chief Mage Mo Ran stood by the window, gazing down at the bustling metropolis below. Dressed in deep blue robes embroidered with golden magical patterns along the sleeves and collar, he held a crystal staff that emitted a faint blue glow.

"**Master, the 'Black Skull' has returned and is expected to arrive at the imperial port tomorrow,**" a young apprentice mage reported respectfully.

Mo Ran nodded slightly, a complex expression flickering in his eyes. "**Notify Lord Max that I need to meet with him.**"

After the apprentice left, Mo Ran turned to the bookshelf, retrieving an ancient tome and opening its rune-covered pages. Five years had passed—finally, that ship had returned, along with its captain—Fu Chen, the Imperial Expeditionary General—who would bring back the secrets of the Eastern Continent.

---

Meanwhile, the Imperial Ministry of Agriculture was abuzz with activity.

"Minister Ying Huo, this year’s northern harvest is twenty percent lower than expected. I fear..."

Ying Huo, dressed in an elegant pink robe, gently waved a hand, interrupting the subordinate's report. As the effeminate male minister of the Imperial Ministry of Agriculture, his delicate makeup concealed a pair of wise eyes.

"**We have prepared for this. Mobilize the southern grain reserves,**" he said calmly. "**By the way, where is General DW?**"

"General DW went to the port early this morning, saying an important ship was returning."

Ying Huo nodded thoughtfully. "**Fu Chen General has returned... Tell General DW to convene an emergency meeting tonight at the 'Moon Drunken Pavilion.'**"

---

Off the coast of the Imperial Port, a massive black warship slowly approached. Towering in size, its bow carved with a skull motif, the ship’s flag fluttered proudly in the sea breeze.

Inside the captain’s cabin, General Fu Chen stood before a nautical chart. Tall and imposing, his stern face bore a scar over his left eye—a testament to countless battles.

"General, the empire has sent a messenger pigeon ordering us to slow our approach and delay entry until tomorrow," the first mate reported.

Fu Chen sneered. "**That old fox Mo Ran must be getting impatient. Five years ago, he obstructed our eastern expedition. Now that I’ve returned with evidence of his conspiracy, of course he can’t sit still.**"

"Then what should we do?"

"**Proceed as planned. Dock secretly tonight. Notify Du Shou on shore to prepare for our arrival,**" Fu Chen said, stroking the ebony hilt of his sword, his eyes glinting coldly.

---

Within the cherry blossom garden of the Marquisate Estate on the western outskirts of the capital, Marquis Xiao Mo strolled with his wife, Pei Luo Luo.

"Husband, you seem troubled today?" Pei Luo Luo gently handed him a cup of hot tea.

Xiao Mo accepted the tea, gazing into the distance. "**General Fu Chen is returning. I fear great trouble lies ahead.** Five years ago, that eastern expedition concealed secrets unknown to most."

"Is it about Master Mo Ran?"

Xiao Mo sighed. "Mo Ran and Fu Chen—one the empire’s most powerful mage, the other its bravest general. If they truly oppose each other, the entire empire may fall into chaos."

Pei Luo Luo softly stroked her husband’s hand. "**Lord Max won’t stand idly by.**"

"Lord Max is enigmatic; no one can predict his intentions," Xiao Mo frowned. "**Still, I’ve already summoned Nan Feng for assistance. Though he’s lived in seclusion as a fisherman for years, his strength remains unfathomable.**"

---

As night fell, an unassuming fishing boat quietly approached the Black Skull. Standing aboard was a middle-aged man who appeared to be an ordinary fisherman—Nan Feng.

"Old friend, long time no see," Nan Feng leapt onto the deck, exchanging a knowing smile with Fu Chen.

Fu Chen clapped him on the shoulder. "**Things are more complicated than we imagined.** Mo Ran is backed by a mysterious force. What they seek could topple the entire empire."

Nan Feng nodded. "I’ve already informed Du Shou. He’ll be waiting for us at the North Gate."

Fu Chen retrieved an ancient jade pendant from his robe. "**This is the 'Primordial Spirit Jade' we found on the Eastern Continent. It can activate the ancient magical array slumbering beneath the empire. Mo Ran wants it, but we must see Lord Max first.**"

"Be careful—I sense magical fluctuations," Nan Feng suddenly warned, glancing toward the sky.

Above them, countless blue lights gathered rapidly, forming a vast net descending upon the Black Skull.

"It’s Mo Ran! He’s found us!" Fu Chen roared, drawing his sword.

Nan Feng formed intricate hand seals. "**Wind Release: Clear Skies!**"

---

Atop the Central Tower, Mo Ran’s eyes glowed as he pointed his staff toward the port. "**Fu Chen, did you really think you could escape my detection? Tonight, we settle the score from five years ago!**"

### **Chapter 2: First Clash**

The blue magical net descended upon the Black Skull with lightning speed. Fu Chen unsheathed his sword, its blade igniting with black flames as he slashed upward.

"**Break!**"

With a thunderous roar, the black flames surged skyward like a dragon, colliding with the net and tearing a massive rift. Yet the net quickly began to repair itself.

Seeing this, Nan Feng’s hands flew through complex seals. "**Wind Release: Sky-Splitting Gale!**"

A powerful whirlwind erupted from his palms, slicing through the net with countless wind blades. Together, they finally shattered the magical barrier.

"**Full speed ahead—make for shore!**" Fu Chen commanded. "**Mo Ran must have set an ambush on land.**"

The Black Skull surged toward the harbor. Meanwhile, dozens of blue-robed mages had gathered onshore, led by Mo Ran himself, floating midair with staff raised.

"**Fu Chen, hand over the Primordial Spirit Jade, and I may yet spare your life!**" Mo Ran declared.

Fu Chen sneered. "**Mo Ran, five years ago you sabotaged my expedition, killing thousands of my soldiers. Today, I will repay that blood debt!**"

Before the ship could dock, Fu Chen leapt into the air, his black-flamed sword slicing through the night sky straight for Mo Ran’s throat. Unfazed, Mo Ran tapped his staff, instantly forming a blue barrier.

*Clang!*

The sword struck the barrier, sparks flying. Seizing the moment, Mo Ran retaliated, his staff flicking rapidly as dozens of blue spears materialized and rained down upon Fu Chen.

Darting through the air, Fu Chen evaded most of the spears, shattering the rest with his black-flamed sword. High above the harbor, the two clashed fiercely, their sword strikes and spells illuminating the battlefield.

Seeing this, Nan Feng shouted to those aboard. "**Proceed as planned—I’ll assist Fu Chen!**"

In an instant, Nan Feng transformed into a wisp of green smoke, appearing on the opposite side of the battlefield. With a thrust of both palms, he unleashed: "**Wind Release: Sky-Splitting Blade!**"

A massive green wind blade sliced through the air toward Mo Ran’s back. Sensing danger, Mo Ran redirected his barrier just in time to block the strike.

At that very moment, Fu Chen seized the opening, driving his black-flamed sword through the barrier, piercing a small hole. Mo Ran grunted in pain, retreating hastily as blood seeped through a tear in his robe.

"**Impressive, Imperial Expeditionary General. Your strength has grown much in five years,**" Mo Ran said coldly. His staff suddenly flew from his grasp, swelling into a massive blue serpent that coiled toward Fu Chen.

Unfazed, Fu Chen swung his sword, black flames blazing. "**Soul-Blazing Slash!**"

The sword flash cut the serpent in half like black lightning. Yet the severed halves transformed into countless smaller serpents, continuing their assault.

Just then, a loud shout came from the harbor’s edge. "**Fu Chen—catch!**"

Du Shou, the burly general, charged into the fray, hurling an ancient shield. Fu Chen caught it, golden runes flaring across its surface, forming a protective barrier that deflected the serpents.

"Old friend, you’ve arrived just in time!" Fu Chen laughed.

Du Shou grinned. "How could I let you have all the glory? General DW is preparing a diversion in the city—we must escape!"

Mo Ran’s expression darkened. Hands forming seals, he intoned: "**Binding Array: Ten Thousand Shackles!**"

Instantly, a complex blue array materialized above the harbor, countless magical chains descending to ensnare the trio.

Nan Feng pulled out a talisman. "**No choice now... Wind Release: Instant Shadow Travel!**"

The talisman burned, enveloping them in a green whirlwind. As the magical chains nearly touched them, the whirlwind contracted, and the three vanished, leaving only a wisp of green smoke behind.

Mo Ran stared at the empty space, a flicker of anger crossing his face before returning to calm. "**You may escape tonight, but not by dawn. Seal the city—search for Fu Chen and his accomplices.**"

---

In a hidden underground wine cellar in the northern part of the city, General DW paced anxiously. Suddenly, green smoke swirled, and Fu Chen, Nan Feng, and Du Shou appeared.

"Finally!" DW exhaled in relief. "How did it go?"

Fu Chen’s expression was grave. "**Mo Ran was prepared. His strength has grown significantly since five years ago.** The city is likely under martial law—we must see Lord Max as soon as possible."

Nan Feng leaned weakly against the wall. "That last technique drained me—I need rest."

Du Shou patted Nan Feng’s shoulder. "Old friend, we owe you our lives."

DW spread a map. "I’ve prepared a route to the City Lord’s mansion. But Mo Ran’s mages are searching the city—we must move carefully."

Fu Chen nodded. "**Rest first—we move before dawn. This battle has only just begun.**"

### **Chapter 3: Urban Battle**

Before dawn, the Imperial Capital lay beneath an eerie blue glow. Mo Ran stood atop the Central Tower, arms outstretched, chanting incantations. Hundreds of mages stationed throughout the city formed a vast magical array, blue threads weaving through the sky.

"**Spiritual Eye—Seek and Locate!**" Mo Ran intoned, and the city-wide array flared with blinding light.

Inside the Ministry of Agriculture office, Ying Huo gazed out the window, brow furrowed. Footsteps approached from behind, but without turning, he said, "Mo Ran has gone all out—even daring to use forbidden techniques within the city."

It was Xiao Mo who had entered, his expression serious. "**Pei Luo Luo has prepared the cherry blossom estate as a safe house. Is the Primordial Spirit Jade truly that important?**"

Ying Huo turned, his usually delicate features now stern. "**That jade determines the empire’s fate. Five years ago, Mo Ran obstructed Fu Chen’s eastern expedition precisely to prevent him from discovering the Eastern Continent’s secrets.**"

"So what do we do now?"

"**Follow the plan—support Fu Chen and his group as much as possible,**" Ying Huo said, looking out the window. "**I hope Lord Max already knows of this.**"

---

In the underground wine cellar, Fu Chen and his companions prepared to depart.

"Do you feel it?" Nan Feng looked up at the ceiling. "Mo Ran has activated the Spiritual Eye—his surveillance covers the entire city."

Du Shou grinned. "Then let’s give him something to see." He pulled out several metallic spheres. "These are the 'Phantom Bombs' DW and I designed—they disrupt magical detection."

DW added, "**I’ve arranged several teams to create diversions across the city, drawing Mo Ran’s attention. Now, we split up.**"

Fu Chen nodded. "I’ll carry the Primordial Spirit Jade. Du Shou, you and Nan Feng take the eastern route; DW, you handle the west; I’ll push straight through the center to the City Lord’s mansion."

The four clasped hands, determination burning in their eyes.

"**No matter the outcome, after today, the empire will never be the same,**" Fu Chen declared solemnly.

---

In the eastern market, an explosion suddenly erupted, sending thick smoke billowing into the sky. Civilians fled in panic as mage guards quickly mobilized. Amidst the chaos, Du Shou and Nan Feng moved swiftly.

"Left front, three o’clock position—five mages," Nan Feng whispered.

Du Shou smirked. "Leave it to me!" He drew two short axes and hurled them. The blades pierced two mages’ shoulders, pinning them to the wall.

The remaining three mages reacted instantly, blue energy spheres forming in their hands. Nan Feng flashed behind them. "**Wind Release: Silent Blade!**"

An invisible gust swept through, and the three mages collapsed silently. Nan Feng checked them. "Just unconscious—I didn’t go too hard."

Du Shou retrieved his axes. "Don’t be too merciful—they won’t show us any. Keep moving—we rendezvous with Fu Chen at the northern market."

---

The western garrison camp was equally chaotic. DW, clad in general’s armor, strode confidently through the center.

"General!" a guard saluted. "Chief Mage Mo Ran has ordered full alert—search for the traitor General Fu Chen!"

DW nodded expressionlessly and continued walking. Reaching the camp’s center, he stopped,取出 a small box from his robe and opened it.

"**Activate.**"

Dozens of mechanical hummingbirds flew out, scattering in all directions. Before the guards could react, the birds exploded, releasing thick white smoke.

"Intruders!" the guards shouted, but soon collapsed unconscious within the smoke.

DW donned a special mask and walked calmly through the smoke. A voice suddenly came from behind. "General Pingyuan, is this treason?"

DW turned to face a high-ranking mage in blue robes, his body encased in a blue energy field that repelled the smoke.

"Mo Ran’s prized disciple?" DW sneered. "**It’s your master who’s the traitor.**"

The mage scoffed. "Such blasphemy warrants death!" He thrust both hands forward, sending a blue energy beam toward DW.

DW didn’t flinch. His right hand transformed into a metallic claw, grabbing and crushing the beam.

"What?!" the mage exclaimed in shock.

DW lunged, the claw pressing against the mage’s throat. "**Five years ago during the eastern expedition, I lost my right arm—replaced with this mechanical one. It was General Fu Chen’s gift, and the reason I follow him. Now, sleep.**"

A light tap, and the mage collapsed. DW glanced toward the City Lord’s mansion. "General Fu Chen, I hope your path is clear."

---

Along the central avenue, Fu Chen, disguised as a merchant, moved cautiously through the crowd. The Spiritual Eye’s blue glow blanketed the city, forcing him to slow his pace.

Suddenly, a squad of mages appeared ahead, searching house to house. Fu Chen turned to avoid them, only to find another patrol blocking his rear.

"Damn—it’s an encirclement," Fu Chen muttered, gripping his sword.

Just then, an ornate carriage pulled up from a side street. The curtain parted, revealing Ying Huo’s delicate face. "Merchant, need a ride?"

Fu Chen hesitated, then understood, quickly boarding the carriage. It passed through the mage squad without challenge.

"Agriculture Minister personally coming to my aid—I’m honored," Fu Chen whispered.

Ying Huo smiled. "**A pillar of the nation deserves assistance.** I’ve arranged a safe route directly to the City Lord’s mansion garden."

Fu Chen’s expression darkened. "Mo Ran won’t let us go easily."

As if on cue, a loud explosion tore through the carriage roof. Bright light flooded in as Mo Ran’s cold voice rang out.

"**Found you, Fu Chen!**"

Fu Chen kicked open the door and leapt out, sword drawn. Ying Huo followed, now holding a pink folding fan inscribed with glowing runes.

On the street, Mo Ran hovered midair, surrounded by dozens of mages. Civilians had fled, leaving only the opposing forces.

"Hand over the Primordial Spirit Jade, and I’ll spare your life," Mo Ran demanded coldly.

Fu Chen sneered. "Five years ago, you said the same thing—then my three thousand soldiers perished at sea!"

Mo Ran shook his head. "**That was a necessary sacrifice. The Primordial Spirit Jade would bring catastrophe upon the empire if it returned.**"

"Lies!" Fu Chen roared. "Ancient texts I discovered in the East clearly state the Primordial Spirit Jade is a sacred relic left by our ancestors—it can activate the slumbering protective array beneath the empire, shielding us from foreign invaders!"

"Foolish!" Mo Ran’s eyes glowed blue. "Those are mere illusions! The truth hidden behind the Primordial Spirit Jade is beyond your comprehension!"

Ying Huo suddenly interjected. "**Chief Mage Mo Ran, are you afraid the Primordial Spirit Jade will expose your true identity?**"

Mo Ran’s face paled. "Ying Huo, you—"

Before he could finish, Fu Chen lunged, black-flamed sword aimed at Mo Ran’s throat. "**Enough talk—I’ll take your life today!**"

Mo Ran waved his staff, forming a blue barrier that blocked the attack. The two instantly engaged in fierce combat, sword strikes and spells lighting up the street.

Ying Huo unfurled his fan. "**Mages, forgive me. Illusionary Flowers—Thousand Butterflies Dance!**"

A wave of pink butterflies flew from the fan, scattering toward the surrounding mages. Though delicate, they pierced magical defenses—any mage touched fell into a trance, losing combat ability.

Soon, most mages lay unconscious, murmuring incoherently. Ying Huo closed his fan, watching Fu Chen and Mo Ran’s aerial battle.

High above, their clash had reached its peak. Fu Chen’s black-flame sword technique was devastating, each strike capable of tearing through magic itself. Mo Ran countered effortlessly, his staff conjuring countless blue spells like shooting stars.

"**Soul-Blaze—Explosive Slash!**" Fu Chen raised his sword, black flames coalescing into a dragon that slashed downward.

Mo Ran clasped his hands, staff hovering before him. "**Forbidden Technique—Celestial Barrier!**"

A massive blue wall formed, meeting Fu Chen’s dragon in a thunderous explosion. The opposing forces held briefly before collapsing simultaneously, the shockwave shattering nearby windows.

Seizing the moment, Fu Chen closed in, sword tip aimed at Mo Ran’s chest. Mo Ran barely dodged, but his robe was slashed, leaving a shallow wound.

"**So you’ve been holding back,**" Mo Ran sneered. "**Five years ago, you couldn’t match me—and neither can you today!**"

Suddenly, Mo Ran tore open his robe, revealing a body covered in glowing blue runes. They brightened as his form turned translucent, crystalline.

"**Forbidden Technique—Elemental Transformation!**"

Mo Ran’s body fully transformed into a blue energy being, speed and strength vastly enhanced. He charged Fu Chen like lightning, each strike carrying world-shattering force.

Fu Chen retreated step by step, his black-flame sword now cracked, moments from breaking.

"General!" Ying Huo cried anxiously. "Let me help!"

Just as Mo Ran prepared a killing blow, a golden arrow shot from afar, striking his energy form and causing a brief hesitation.

All turned toward the arrow’s origin—City Lord’s mansion, where a figure stood atop a high tower.

"Is that... Lord Max?" Ying Huo gasped.

Mo Ran regained composure, face darkening. "Impossible! Why would you intervene?!"

The figure drew again, another golden arrow piercing the air. Mo Ran dared not block it, retreating hastily and reverting to human form.

"**General Fu Chen—come to the City Lord’s mansion!**" Lord Max’s voice rang out, powerful and authoritative.

Seizing the opportunity, Fu Chen sheathed his broken sword and called to Ying Huo. "Let’s go!"

The two sprinted toward the City Lord’s mansion. Mo Ran tried to pursue but found himself restrained by an invisible force.

"**Enough, Mo Ran,**" Lord Max’s voice came again. "**The time has come to settle what happened five years ago.**"

Mo Ran’s expression shifted between anger and calculation before he finally snorted. "As you wish, Lord Max. But this battle is far from over."

With that, he vanished in a streak of blue light.

Fu Chen and Ying Huo sprinted through the streets, finally reaching the City Lord’s mansion garden, where Du Shou, Nan Feng, and DW awaited.

"General!" they called in unison.

Fu Chen, panting, managed a smile. "**We made it—we’ve finally met Lord Max.**"

At that moment, Lord Max appeared in the garden’s center. Dressed in golden robes, his face remained hidden beneath a hood, exuding an aura of mystery.

"**General Fu Chen, welcome back,**" Lord Max said calmly. "**Show me the treasure you’ve brought from the Eastern Continent.**"

Fu Chen knelt, retrieving the ancient jade pendant—the Primordial Spirit Jade—from his robe.

"Lord Max, this is the truth I paid for with three thousand soldiers’ lives."

## **Volume II: The Battle for Truth**

### **Chapter 4: Past Secrets and Hidden Truths**

Inside the highest chamber of the City Lord’s mansion, the atmosphere was heavy. Fu Chen, Nan Feng, Du Shou, DW, and Ying Huo stood on one side, while the Primordial Spirit Jade rested on a crystal pedestal at the center, emitting a faint green glow. Lord Max stood by the window, his back to them, silent.

"**Five years ago, I led an expedition to the Eastern Continent,**" Fu Chen broke the silence. "**Officially, it was to expand our territory—but secretly, I was tasked with finding the legendary Primordial Spirit Jade.**"

Lord Max turned slowly. "Who gave you this secret mission?"

"The former City Lord’s advisor. Before his death, he told me the Primordial Spirit Jade is the empire’s most sacred protective relic—it was stolen by enemy nations during the great war a thousand years ago and hidden in the Eastern Continent."

Nan Feng added, "As a former court historian, I confirm ancient records mention the Primordial Spirit Jade—it can activate the protective array buried beneath the empire."

Lord Max nodded. "Continue."

Fu Chen’s expression darkened. "**During the expedition, our fleet encountered an unexplained magical storm, suffering heavy losses. Only later did I learn Mo Ran secretly orchestrated it—he didn’t want us to find the Primordial Spirit Jade.**"

"Can you prove it?" Lord Max asked.

DW stepped forward. "I have evidence." He produced a small recording crystal. "I seized this from one of Mo Ran’s disciples—it records the magical storm’s casting process five years ago."

The crystal activated, revealing blue light images of Mo Ran directing mages in the ritual.

Lord Max remained silent for a moment. "Fu Chen, how did you find the Primordial Spirit Jade?"

"Deep within the Eastern Continent, we discovered a heavily guarded ancient temple. **After losing most of our forces, we finally reached the core chamber and found this jade and some ancient texts.**" Fu Chen pointed to the jade. "**The texts state the Primordial Spirit Jade must be placed in the central temple’s array during a full moon to awaken the slumbering protective formation.**"

"And the full moon is three days from now," Nan Feng added.

Lord Max approached the crystal pedestal, studying the jade closely. "**Mo Ran’s actions are indeed suspicious, yet he has always been loyal as the empire’s Chief Mage. Why would he go to such lengths to stop the Primordial Spirit Jade’s return?**"

Ying Huo shook his head gently. "I have a bold theory. **Chief Mage Mo Ran may not be who we believe him to be.**"

Everyone turned to Ying Huo in surprise.

"What do you mean?" Du Shou asked.

Ying Huo produced a silk scroll. "This is a portrait of Mo Ran before he became Chief Mage." He unrolled it, pointing to Mo Ran’s eyes. "Notice this—his eyes were brown back then."

DW frowned. "But now Mo Ran’s eyes are blue."

"**Initially, I thought it was due to excessive spellcasting,**" Ying Huo continued. "**But today, seeing him use the Elemental Transformation technique, I’m certain—Mo Ran has likely been possessed or replaced.**"

Fu Chen stood abruptly. "**That explains his fear of the Primordial Spirit Jade! If it activates the protective array, any foreign presence lurking within the empire would be expelled or destroyed!**"

Lord Max pondered. "This theory is plausible, but we need more evidence. Before deciding our next move, I must speak with Mo Ran myself."

Just then, the sky outside darkened abruptly, storm clouds gathering, blue lightning splitting the heavens.

"Not good!" Nan Feng rushed to the window. "**Mo Ran has activated some large-scale spell atop the Central Tower!**"

Lord Max’s eyes sharpened. "**It seems he can’t wait any longer. Fu Chen, protect the Primordial Spirit Jade—I’ll confront him.**"

---

Atop the Central Tower, Mo Ran raised his hands, surrounded by a swirling vortex of blue energy. Hundreds of mages assisted from various levels of the tower, the entire structure bathed in blue light.

"**Forbidden Technique—Dimensional Rift!**" Mo Ran chanted, his voice no longer human but metallic.

Above the tower, a glowing fissure formed in the clouds, spewing countless blue energy beings that circled above the city.

"Mo Ran!" a voice roared.

Lord Max appeared opposite him atop the tower, golden robes billowing, hood fallen to reveal a stern face. In his right hand, a golden bow; in his left, an arrow glowing with light.

"Cease your spell, or I won’t hold back!"

Mo Ran turned, revealing an eerie smile. "**Too late, Lord Max. My master is about to descend—the world will embrace a new order!**"

With that, he plunged his staff into the magical array at the tower’s center. Blue light exploded outward. The dimensional rift rapidly expanded, a massive blue figure emerging within it.

Lord Max didn’t hesitate—he drew and released. The golden arrow shot through the air, aimed straight for Mo Ran’s throat. Yet just before impact, a blue barrier materialized, blocking the arrow.

"**Mortal weapons cannot harm the messenger of the gods,**" Mo Ran’s voice grew increasingly alien. "**For five years, I’ve prepared for this moment. The Primordial Spirit Jade should have remained buried in the East forever, but that fool Fu Chen had to bring it back.**"

Lord Max drew again. "So you admit—you sabotaged the expedition fleet five years ago?"

"A necessary sacrifice," Mo Ran waved dismissively. "**Compared to what’s coming, those losses were insignificant.**"

Lord Max released another arrow—not aimed at Mo Ran, but at the magical array at the tower’s center. The arrow struck, causing the array to crack and the rift’s expansion to slow.

"**You!**" Mo Ran roared.

"I’ve long suspected you, Mo Ran," Lord Max said calmly. "**Or rather, whatever occupies Mo Ran’s body.**"

Mo Ran’s face contorted, blue light visible beneath his skin. "Clever Lord Max, but you cannot stop destiny."

With that, he clapped his hands together, blue light erupting from within. "**Sacrifice—All Spirits Unite!**"

Instantly, every mage assisting in the ritual stiffened, their life energy drawn out as blue specks flowing into Mo Ran. His body swelled rapidly, skin tearing to reveal an inner crystalline structure.

"This is... a sacrifice spell?" Lord Max exclaimed in shock.

Mo Ran had fully transformed into a blue crystal giant, nearly ten feet tall, his voice like thunder. "**Now, you face my true form!**"

---

Inside the City Lord’s mansion, Fu Chen and his companions watched the scene unfold through a magical projection.

"Good heavens—Mo Ran isn’t even human!" Ying Huo gasped.

Fu Chen’s expression hardened. "**We must act immediately—while the dimensional rift is slowed, we must deliver the Primordial Spirit Jade to the Central Temple!**"

"But the full moon is still three days away," DW reminded him.

Nan Feng shook his head. "Given the emergency, we have no choice. The Primordial Spirit Jade’s power may not fully activate, but it should counter Mo Ran’s scheme."

Fu Chen nodded. "Du Shou, DW—you’ll guard the City Lord’s mansion with the troops. Nan Feng, Ying Huo—you’ll accompany me to the Central Temple."

The group dispersed quickly. Fu Chen carefully placed the Primordial Spirit Jade into a special case and, with Nan Feng and Ying Huo, set off toward the Central Temple.

Above the city, Lord Max and the crystal giant Mo Ran were locked in fierce combat. Lord Max no longer used his bow but wielded a golden longsword, clashing with Mo Ran’s crystalline claws. Each impact sent shockwaves through the air.

"**What are you, truly?**" Lord Max demanded mid-combat.

The crystal giant sneered. "**We are beings from beyond the dimensional rift—you call us the 'Blue Crystal Clan.' A thousand years ago, we tried to conquer this world but were stopped by the Primordial Spirit Jade. Now, we return!**"

Lord Max shifted his sword, slashing at Mo Ran’s crystalline arm. "And the real Mo Ran?"

"His consciousness has long since vanished—only this perfect vessel remains, carrying my power!" Mo Ran slammed a crystalline palm toward Lord Max. "**Your empire will fall—the new era will be ruled by the Blue Crystal Clan!**"

Lord Max dodged, his sword flashing like a waterfall. "As long as I live, the empire will not fall!"

Their battle intensified, energy shockwaves collapsing buildings across the city. Civilians fled in panic as chaos engulfed the capital.

---

On their way to the Central Temple, Fu Chen, Nan Feng, and Ying Huo frequently changed routes to avoid collapsing structures and raging energy storms.

"The temple square is just ahead!" Ying Huo pointed forward.

Yet as they neared, dozens of blue-glowing "mages" suddenly appeared, blocking their path.

"Not ordinary mages..." Nan Feng observed carefully. "They’ve been fully converted into Blue Crystal Clan puppets!"

Fu Chen drew his spare sword. "**No matter what, we must break through!**"

The trio charged the puppet mages. Fu Chen’s sword technique was devastating, each strike severing energy connections; Nan Feng’s wind techniques disrupted their senses; Ying Huo’s illusions sent many into confusion.

Just as the battle reached its peak, a familiar voice called out. "General Fu Chen—this way!"

Xiao Mo and Pei Luo Luo appeared from a side street, followed by lightly armored warriors.

"Marquis Xiao Mo!" Fu Chen exclaimed in relief.

Xiao Mo quickly ordered, "Cover the general’s path to the temple!"

The warriors scattered, firing special arrows that forced the puppets back. Pei Luo Luo raised a crystal staff, clearing a safe passage ahead.

"**Hurry—we’ll hold them off!**" Xiao Mo urged.

Fu Chen nodded gratefully and, with Nan Feng and Ying Huo, rushed toward the temple gates.

The Central Temple was the empire’s oldest structure, standing unbroken for a thousand years. Its massive stone doors slowly opened as the trio entered. Inside, the vast chamber was solemn and majestic, with a large circular array at its center, surrounded by ancient runes.

"This is it," Nan Feng pointed to a recess in the array’s center. "The Primordial Spirit Jade should be placed here."

Fu Chen retrieved the jade, moving forward—when suddenly a blue beam struck his arm from above. The jade flew from his grasp, landing on the ground.

"**Don’t even think about it!**"

The three looked up to see the temple’s dome shattered, and Mo Ran’s crystal giant form descending slowly. Though damaged from his battle with Lord Max, his presence remained terrifying.

"Where’s Lord Max?" Fu Chen demanded.

Mo Ran sneered. "**Your City Lord is temporarily trapped in a spatial rift—he won’t be free anytime soon. Now, hand over the Primordial Spirit Jade!**"

Ying Huo quietly signaled Fu Chen. "Distract him—I’ll retrieve the jade."

Fu Chen gave an almost imperceptible nod, then shouted. "Mo Ran! No—Blue Crystal Clan invader! **Five years ago, you killed three thousand of my soldiers—I will repay that blood debt today!**"

With that, Fu Chen unsheathed his sword, black flames blazing. Nan Feng joined him, unleashing his full wind techniques. Together, they attacked Mo Ran, trying to divert his attention.

Mo Ran scoffed. "**Mere ants dare challenge a god?**"

With a casual wave, he sent two blue energy waves that sent Fu Chen and Nan Feng flying backward, crashing into stone pillars, blood spilling from their mouths.

At that moment, Ying Huo had quietly reached the Primordial Spirit Jade and swiftly picked it up.

"**Stop!**" Mo Ran sensed the movement, swiping a massive energy claw toward Ying Huo.

Ying Huo couldn’t dodge in time—struck full force, he flew several meters, slamming into a stone wall. Yet as he was thrown back, he hurled the jade toward the array’s center.

The Primordial Spirit Jade arced gracefully through the air, landing precisely in the recess.

"No!" Mo Ran roared, charging toward the array.

But it was too late. The moment the jade settled, the entire array flared with brilliant green light. The light spread rapidly, forming an energy barrier that blocked Mo Ran’s advance.

"**Primordial Spirit Jade, guardian of the empire, heed my call...**" Fu Chen struggled to his feet, beginning an ancient incantation.

Mo Ran attacked the barrier furiously, blue energy clashing with the green shield, emitting a piercing hum. "**You think this will stop me? The Primordial Spirit Jade’s power only fully activates during the full moon—this is mere drops in the ocean!**"

Nan Feng also rose, continuing the chant. "**Ancient covenant, slumbering power, awaken in this time of imperial peril...**"

Ying Huo, weakly crawling up, joined the incantation. "**In the name of our ancestors, by the oath of guardianship, expel the foreign invaders...**"

Their voices intertwined, the array’s green light growing brighter. The Primordial Spirit Jade began to spin, emitting pulsating energy waves that spread throughout the temple, then the entire city.

Mo Ran’s crystalline body began cracking further, blue light flickering erratically. "**Impossible! How could the Primordial Spirit Jade activate early?**"

At that moment, the temple doors opened again, and Lord Max appeared, his golden robes torn but his gaze still sharp.

"**Mo Ran—or rather, Blue Crystal Clan invader,**" Lord Max stepped forward. "**You forgot one thing—the Primordial Spirit Jade doesn’t rely solely on lunar power—it also depends on the will of the guardians!**"

Lord Max approached the array’s edge, placing his hand on the green barrier. "**As City Lord of the empire, I invoke the highest authority to activate the protective array!**"

As he spoke, the Primordial Spirit Jade erupted in blinding light, filling the entire temple. Mo Ran’s crystalline body rapidly disintegrated, emitting agonized screams.

"**No! Master... save me...**"

The dimensional rift above began to shrink, the blue energy beings circling the city drawn back into it. Mo Ran’s body fully fragmented into countless blue shards, also sucked into the rift.

Finally, the dimensional rift closed completely, and the sky returned to calm.

Fu Chen, Nan Feng, and Ying Huo collapsed to the ground, exhausted but relieved.

"**We... succeeded?**" Fu Chen gasped.

Lord Max nodded, though his expression remained grave. "**For now. The Primordial Spirit Jade has sealed the dimensional rift, expelling the Blue Crystal Clan’s vanguard. But this is only the beginning—they won’t give up so easily.**"

"And the real Mo Ran?" Ying Huo asked with concern.

Lord Max sighed. "He’s gone. The Blue Crystal Clan fully possessed his body—his soul has long since vanished."

The four fell silent, mourning their fallen comrade.

Fu Chen broke the silence. "What’s our next move?"

Lord Max walked to the array’s center, retrieving the still-glowing Primordial Spirit Jade. "**Wait for the full moon to fully activate its power. Then, prepare for the true war.**"

### **Chapter 5: The Climactic Battle**

Over the next two days, the empire busied itself repairing the city and treating the wounded. Fu Chen and his companions took turns guarding the Primordial Spirit Jade in the Central Temple, preventing any potential attacks.

On the eve of the full moon, Lord Max summoned everyone to the City Lord’s mansion for a meeting.

"According to ancient records, **the Primordial Spirit Jade will reach its peak power during the full moon, permanently sealing the dimensional rift,**" Nan Feng explained, displaying an ancient star chart. "**But this is also the Blue Crystal Clan’s last chance.**"

Lord Max nodded. "**They’ll spare no effort to reclaim the Primordial Spirit Jade or disrupt the ritual.**"

Fu Chen asked, "Has Mo Ran... or rather, that Blue Crystal Clan entity... truly been destroyed?"

"No," Lord Max replied firmly. "**That was only a fragment of him. Based on my deductions, the true 'Mo Ran' has likely infiltrated a far more dangerous location.**"

Everyone exchanged glances.

"Where?" DW pressed.

Lord Max’s expression darkened. "**The underground temple. Beneath the empire lies an even older temple—it’s the true source of the Primordial Spirit Jade’s power. If the Blue Crystal Clan controls it, even activating the Primordial Spirit Jade could backfire.**"

Du Shou frowned. "Underground temple? I’ve never heard of it in military archives."

"**It’s the empire’s highest secret,**" Lord Max explained. "**Only successive City Lords know its entrance. Now, we must split into two teams—one to protect the Primordial Spirit Jade ritual at the Central Temple, the other to accompany me to the underground temple to stop the Blue Crystal Clan.**"

After discussion, it was decided Xiao Mo, Pei Luo Luo, Ying Huo, and DW would guard the Central Temple, while Fu Chen, Nan Feng, and Du Shou accompanied Lord Max to the underground temple.

After the meeting, Fu Chen stood alone on the city wall, gazing into the distance. Night had fallen, the bright moon rising, its silver light bathing the land.

"General, tomorrow’s battle will be recorded in history," Nan Feng said, appearing beside him.

Fu Chen smiled faintly. "**Five years ago, when I set out, I thought the greatest honor would be retrieving the Primordial Spirit Jade. I never imagined it would uncover such a vast secret.**"

Nan Feng sighed. "**History is full of irony. We thought we were defending the empire—only to realize we were saving the entire world.**"

Fu Chen gazed at the moon. "Mo Ran was once my respected rival—shame his body now houses only an alien entity."

"**Tomorrow’s battle will avenge him,**" Nan Feng said resolutely.

---

The full moon night finally arrived.

Inside the Central Temple, Xiao Mo directed the guards’ positioning. Pei Luo Luo and Ying Huo set up additional protective spells around the array. DW checked the mechanical devices he’d brought.

"**According to ancient records, the Primordial Spirit Jade ritual will officially begin at midnight,**" Ying Huo told the group. "**Until then, we must ensure the array remains undisturbed.**"

Xiao Mo nodded. "We’ve set up three layers of defense—outer guards, middle traps, inner guard by us four."

Just then, commotion erupted outside the temple. A guard rushed in. "My lords! The sky is abnormal!"

They rushed out, looking up. The full moon was surrounded by an eerie blue halo, its light unnaturally distorted.

"**It’s begun...**" Ying Huo murmured. "**The Blue Crystal Clan is trying to influence the moon phase, disrupting the Primordial Spirit Jade’s power.**"

DW immediately ordered. "Everyone back to position! Prepare for battle!"

---

Meanwhile, Lord Max led Fu Chen’s group through the oldest underground waterways of the Imperial Capital, heading toward the underground temple.

"This path has existed for over a thousand years," Lord Max explained. "**When the empire was first built, our ancestors foresaw potential foreign invasions and constructed this temple underground as the final line of defense.**"

Fu Chen asked curiously, "If the underground temple is so important, why has it been kept secret all these years? Why not station heavy guards?"

Lord Max smiled bitterly. "**Because it’s not just a defense—it’s also bait. The temple contains a device that lures invaders into an eternal迷失 space. If word got out, we’d lose this advantage.**"

Nan Feng pondered. "So Mo Ran—or rather, that Blue Crystal Clan entity—discovered this secret and wants to destroy the device?"

"No," Lord Max shook his head. "**They want to use the device to open a permanent portal to their world.**"

The group continued deeper. As they descended, ancient runes began appearing on the walls, emitting faint green light.

"**We’re close,**" Lord Max signaled for quiet.

After navigating a winding passage, they reached a massive circular stone door. Its surface was carved with patterns similar to the Primordial Spirit Jade, with a jade recess at its center.

"**We need a key to open it,**" Lord Max retrieved a small jade from his robe, about to insert it into the recess—when he suddenly stopped.

"Something’s wrong. Someone’s already been here."

As if on cue, the stone door slowly opened, blue light spilling through the gap. When fully open, they saw a shocking sight.

An identical figure of Mo Ran stood in the center of the vast underground temple, staff in hand, behind him a massive blue vortex forming. But this "Mo Ran" was fully encased in blue crystal armor, a small blue crown atop his head.

"**Welcome, Lord Max, and esteemed Expeditionary General Fu Chen,**" the Blue Crystal Mo Ran turned, his voice deeper and more powerful. "**I’ve been expecting you.**"

Lord Max’s expression hardened. "**Blue Crystal King... so it’s you who’s descended personally.**"

The Blue Crystal King—now confirmed as the Blue Crystal Clan’s ruler—bowed elegantly. "**I’m honored to be recognized. Five years ago, I projected my consciousness into this world, possessing this esteemed Chief Mage.** Unfortunately, my plan was foiled when you discovered it."

Fu Chen roared. "**How many innocents did you kill just to invade our world?**"

The Blue Crystal King sneered dismissively. "Invade? I prefer to call it 'salvation.' **Your world is destroying itself—we bring a new order.**"

Nan Feng’s gaze sharpened. "**What have you done to the underground temple?**"

"A small modification," the Blue Crystal King gestured toward the blue vortex. "**This device was originally meant to seal invaders—I merely adjusted its direction to connect to my world. Soon, my armies will pour through this portal.**"

Lord Max drew his golden sword. "**Then we’ll stop you.**"

The Blue Crystal King laughed coldly. "**Four ants against a king?**"

Before he finished speaking, Fu Chen launched his attack. His black-flamed sword slashed toward the Blue Crystal King’s throat at incredible speed. Yet the Blue Crystal King merely tilted his head, dodging the fatal strike effortlessly.

"Too slow."

With a casual wave, a blue energy wave struck Fu Chen, sending him flying backward, crashing into a stone pillar.

Nan Feng reacted instantly, forming hand seals. "**Wind Release: Thousand-Blade Storm!**"

Countless wind blades materialized from all directions, attacking the Blue Crystal King. Du Shou joined the assault, dual axes striking from behind.

The Blue Crystal King didn’t dodge. A blue energy shield erupted around him, deflecting all attacks. Then, he raised his palm toward Nan Feng and Du Shou. "**Blue Crystal Technique—Gravity Collapse.**"

Instantly, Nan Feng and Du Shou felt an irresistible force pressing down, pinning them to the ground.

"**Too weak—you’re all too weak,**" the Blue Crystal King sneered. "**Perhaps I should deal with you first, then handle the Primordial Spirit Jade ritual.**"

At that moment, Lord Max appeared behind the Blue Crystal King, golden sword aimed straight for his back. Sensing danger, the Blue Crystal King turned, his right hand transforming into a crystal blade that blocked Lord Max’s sword.

"Not bad, Lord Max."

Lord Max and the Blue Crystal King exchanged dozens of blows in an instant, golden and blue light illuminating the temple. Lord Max’s swordsmanship was exquisite, but the Blue Crystal King’s strength clearly surpassed his. After several exchanges, Lord Max was forced back, a shallow cut appearing on his chest.

"**You’re strong, Lord Max,**" the Blue Crystal King acknowledged. "**In this world, you’re likely the closest to my power. But still, far too weak.**"

With that, the Blue Crystal King transformed into a streak of blue light, appearing before Lord Max, his crystal hand piercing straight through Lord Max’s chest.

"No!" Fu Chen struggled to rise from the rubble, witnessing the scene.

Lord Max looked down at the hand piercing his chest—not with pain, but with a mysterious smile. "**You’ve fallen for it.**"

The Blue Crystal King hesitated, then felt ancient energy surging from Lord Max’s body. Golden light coiled around his arm like chains.

"This is... sealing power?" the Blue Crystal King exclaimed in shock, trying to pull back but finding himself immobilized.

Lord Max coughed blood but his gaze remained firm. "**As successive City Lords, our bodies are the 'keys'—able to activate or seal this temple’s power.**"

As Lord Max spoke, golden runes illuminated the temple floor, opposing the blue vortex. The Blue Crystal King struggled, but the golden chains tightened relentlessly.

"**Foolish sacrifice! Do you really think this will stop me?**" the Blue Crystal King roared.

Lord Max smiled weakly. "**No—it’s merely a delay. The true outcome lies elsewhere.**"

---

Inside the Central Temple, the battle had reached its peak. Waves of Blue Crystal puppets had breached the outer defenses, clashing fiercely with the guards. Xiao Mo and DW held the front line, while Pei Luo Luo and Ying Huo protected the array and Primordial Spirit Jade.

"**There are too many!**" Xiao Mo shouted while fighting.

DW’s mechanical arm was damaged, but he continued battling. "**Hold on! Time’s almost up!**"

Suddenly, the leading Blue Crystal puppets parted, and a new figure stepped forward—an exact replica of Mo Ran, but entirely blue.

"**I am the Blue Crystal King’s deputy,**" the figure’s voice was icy cold. "**Surrender—the Primordial Spirit Jade belongs to me.**"

Xiao Mo shouted fiercely. "**Never!**"

The deputy shook his head. "**Why throw your lives away? Your City Lord has already fallen to the Blue Crystal King—the underground temple is lost.**"

Everyone’s hearts sank, but Ying Huo stepped forward. "**Lies! Lord Max and General Fu Chen won’t fail!**"

The deputy sneered, raising his hand to fire a blue energy beam straight for Ying Huo’s throat. Just as Ying Huo seemed unable to dodge, Pei Luo Luo stepped in front, raising a crystal shield. The beam struck the shield, shattering it but saving Ying Huo’s life.

"**Pei Luo Luo!**" Xiao Mo cried in anguish, rushing toward his wife.

Pei Luo Luo held her arm, burned by the energy beam, but smiled weakly. "**I’m fine... protecting the Primordial Spirit Jade is most important.**"

DW seized the moment, firing mechanical darts from his arm toward the deputy’s vital points. The deputy dodged easily, retaliating with an energy wave that sent DW flying several meters.

"**Time’s running out,**" the deputy glanced at the full moon above the temple dome. "**Hand over the Primordial Spirit Jade—or you’ll all die here.**"

At that moment, the Primordial Spirit Jade began glowing intensely, green light growing stronger. The array activated, bathing the entire temple in green light.

"**It’s time!**" Ying Huo exclaimed in relief. "**The ritual has started automatically!**"

The deputy’s expression changed drastically. "**Impossible! It’s not yet midnight...**"

He suddenly realized something, looking up at the full moon. The blue halo around it had vanished, pure moonlight shining directly onto the array.

"**The underground temple... the Blue Crystal King has failed?**"

---

Inside the underground temple, Lord Max lay dying, pierced by the Blue Crystal King’s hand, but golden chains still bound the Blue Crystal King tightly. Fu Chen, Nan Feng, and Du Shou had regained their mobility and joined the fight.

"**Fu Chen...**" Lord Max called weakly.

Fu Chen rushed to Lord Max’s side as he handed over a small golden key. "**Central control panel... turn counterclockwise three times...**"

The Blue Crystal King, realizing what was happening, roared. "**Stop him! My subordinates!**"

Dozens of blue figures—Blue Crystal warriors—emerged from all corners of the temple, charging toward Fu Chen.

"**Go! We’ll cover you!**" Nan Feng shouted.

Fu Chen gritted his teeth and charged toward the central control panel, cutting down several Blue Crystal warriors along the way. When he finally reached it, three powerful Blue Crystal warriors surrounded him.

"**Not happening!**"

Fu Chen burned his last strength, his black-flamed sword flashing like black lightning, piercing all three warriors’ chests. He himself was severely injured but finally reached the control panel.

The control panel was an ancient stone platform with a golden keyhole at its center. Fu Chen inserted Lord Max’s key and began turning it counterclockwise—the first rotation.

The temple began to shake, golden runes on the floor brightening.

"**No!**" the Blue Crystal King roared, struggling more violently.

Fu Chen continued the second rotation. The blue vortex became unstable, twisting erratically.

"**Kill him!**" the Blue Crystal King commanded.

The remaining Blue Crystal warriors charged Fu Chen without hesitation. Nan Feng unleashed his final strength, performing his strongest wind technique. "**Wind Release: Sky-Cutting Annihilation Blade!**"

A massive crescent-shaped wind blade swept through the entire temple, slicing all charging warriors in half. Nan Feng collapsed from overexertion.

Du Shou protected the dying Lord Max, fighting to his last breath with dual axes.

Fu Chen completed the third rotation. With a *click*, the entire temple blazed with golden light. The blue vortex reversed completely, transforming into a golden vortex.

"**Impossible!**" the Blue Crystal King felt a massive suction pulling him toward the vortex. "**I won’t fail like this!**"

Lord Max, using his last strength, gripped the Blue Crystal King’s arm tightly. "**You’ve lost... return to your own world...**"

The Blue Crystal King was pulled into the golden vortex, desperately trying to grab onto something—but it was futile. With one last furious glare at Lord Max, he vanished completely into the vortex.

The vortex rapidly shrank, finally dissipating into a single point of golden light. The golden runes across the temple gradually dimmed.

Fu Chen weakly approached Lord Max, helping the great City Lord up. "**Lord Max... we succeeded...**"

Lord Max coughed blood but managed a faint smile. "**Yes... we succeeded... the Blue Crystal Clan has been sent back to their world, the dimensional rift permanently sealed.**"

Du Shou checked Lord Max’s injuries and shook his head. Nan Feng crawled over weakly, his expression grave.

Lord Max looked at the three, speaking with great effort. "**Don’t grieve... this is the duty of a City Lord. Fu Chen...**"

"I’m here," Fu Chen gripped Lord Max’s hand tightly.

"**The empire’s future... is in your hands...**" Lord Max struggled to remove the City Lord’s insignia from his chest, handing it to Fu Chen. "**Go to the Central Temple... complete the Primordial Spirit Jade ritual...**"

With those final words, Lord Max closed his eyes, leaving this world he had protected with his life.

---

Inside the Central Temple, the deputy sensed the distant change, his expression shifting dramatically. "**Impossible... how could the Blue Crystal King...**"

Ying Huo saw the opportunity and announced loudly. "**The Blue Crystal King has been defeated! We’ve won!**"

The guards erupted in cheers, morale soaring. The deputy and remaining Blue Crystal puppets visibly panicked.

Just then, the temple doors opened again, and Fu Chen, Nan Feng, and Du Shou entered—battered but resolute.

"**General Fu Chen!**" Xiao Mo called out in relief.

The deputy, realizing the battle was lost, turned to flee. But Fu Chen was ready—his black-flamed sword shot through the air, piercing the deputy’s throat.

"**For Mo Ran, for Lord Max, for all who sacrificed their lives,**" Fu Chen said coldly.

The deputy dissolved into blue specks, and the remaining Blue Crystal puppets collapsed, their energy source gone.

Fu Chen approached the array’s center, placing Lord Max’s City Lord insignia beside the Primordial Spirit Jade. Instantly, green and golden light merged, forming a pillar of light shooting straight into the sky.

Across the entire city—and indeed, the entire empire—residents witnessed this miraculous sight. The light lasted a full quarter-hour before gradually fading. When the light disappeared, the Primordial Spirit Jade and City Lord insignia had fused into a single new insignia.

Fu Chen picked up the insignia, sighing deeply. "**It’s finally over...**"

Nan Feng shook his head. "**No—it’s a new beginning.**"

### **Epilogue: A New Dawn**

Three months later, a grand coronation ceremony was held in the Imperial Central Square. Fu Chen was officially inaugurated as the new City Lord of the Imperial Capital, wearing the newly fused insignia combining the Primordial Spirit Jade.

Nan Feng was appointed Chief Mage of the Empire, succeeding Mo Ran; Du Shou became Commander of the Royal Guard; DW was promoted to Governor of Pingyuan; Ying Huo continued as Minister of Agriculture; Xiao Mo and Pei Luo Luo were tasked with foreign affairs.

During the coronation banquet, the new City Lord Fu Chen raised his cup in a toast.

"**Today, we honor those who sacrificed their lives defending the empire—Chief Mage Mo Ran, whose soul was taken by the Blue Crystal Clan, yet whose wisdom and contributions endure; Lord Max, who gave his life to seal the enemy and protect our world.**"

Everyone raised their cups in silent tribute.

Fu Chen continued. "**The threat of the Blue Crystal Clan has passed, but this is not the end—it’s a new beginning. The empire will grow stronger, more united.**"

Nan Feng added. "**We’ve already begun researching the Primordial Spirit Jade’s power, strengthening the empire’s defenses to prevent similar invasions.**"

After the banquet, Fu Chen stood alone on the City Lord’s mansion balcony, gazing at the Central Temple in the distance and the bright moon beyond.

"Missing the old days?" Nan Feng joined him.

Fu Chen smiled faintly. "**Sometimes I still prefer being a captain and general over being City Lord.**"

Nan Feng patted his shoulder. "**You’ll become a great City Lord, just like Lord Max.**"

Fu Chen looked down at the insignia on his chest, glowing with green and golden light. "**Sometimes I feel Lord Max’s will still exists within this insignia, guiding me.**"

"**That’s a good thing,**" Nan Feng gazed at the stars. "**The wisdom of successive City Lords will be passed down through the Primordial Spirit Jade.**"

Fu Chen nodded, his gaze firm. "**Whatever challenges lie ahead, we’ll face them together.**"

In the distance, atop the Central Temple, a faint green light still glowed softly, guarding this ancient and great empire—and heralding the arrival of a new era of peace and prosperity.
