## Basic Syntax and Usage

The basic syntax of grep is:

```
grep [options] pattern [files...]
```

### Example 1: Basic Search

Assume we have a file named `水果.txt` with the following content:

```txt
苹果
香蕉
樱桃
枣
无花果
葡萄
```

Search for lines containing "苹果":

```bash
grep "苹果" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```txt
苹果
```

### Example 2: Search Multiple Files

Create another file `蔬菜.txt`:

```txt
胡萝卜
芹菜
生菜
土豆
番茄
```

Search for lines containing "a" in both files:

```bash
grep "a" 水果.txt 蔬菜.txt
```

Output:

```txt
水果.txt:苹果
水果.txt:香蕉
水果.txt:葡萄
蔬菜.txt:胡萝卜
蔬菜.txt:土豆
蔬菜.txt:番茄
```

## Detailed Explanation of Common Options

### -i: Case-insensitive Search

```bash
echo "Apple" >> 水果.txt
grep -i "apple" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
苹果
Apple
```

### -v: Invert Match

Display lines that do not contain "a":

```bash
grep -v "a" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
樱桃
无花果
```

### -n: Show Line Numbers

```bash
grep -n "a" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
1:苹果
2:香蕉
6:葡萄
7:Apple
```

### -r or -R: Recursive Search

Assume we have a directory named `食物` containing `水果.txt` and `蔬菜.txt`:

```bash
grep -r "to" 食物/
```

Output:

```
食物/蔬菜.txt:土豆
食物/蔬菜.txt:番茄
```

### -l: Show Only Filenames

```bash
grep -l "a" 食物/*
```

Output:

```
食物/水果.txt
食物/蔬菜.txt
```

### -c: Count Matching Lines

```bash
grep -c "a" 水果.txt 蔬菜.txt
```

Output:

```
水果.txt:3
蔬菜.txt:3
```

### -w: Match Whole Words

```bash
echo "葡萄柚" >> 水果.txt
grep -w "葡萄" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
葡萄
```

### -A, -B, -C: Show Context

```bash
grep -A 1 -B 1 "樱桃" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
香蕉
樱桃
枣
```

## Advanced Regular Expressions

grep supports powerful regular expressions. Here are some advanced examples:

### Example 1: Matching Line Start and End

Match lines starting with "a":

```bash
grep "^a" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
苹果
```

Match lines ending with "e":

```bash
grep "e$" 水果.txt 蔬菜.txt
```

Output:

```
水果.txt:苹果
蔬菜.txt:生菜
```

### Example 2: Using Character Classes

Match lines containing numbers (assuming we added some lines with numbers to `水果.txt`):

```bash
echo "2 个苹果" >> 水果.txt
echo "3 根香蕉" >> 水果.txt
grep "[0-9]" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
2 个苹果
3 根香蕉
```

### Example 3: Using Quantifiers

Match words containing two consecutive vowels:

```bash
grep -E "[aeiou]{2}" 水果.txt 蔬菜.txt
```

Output:

```
水果.txt:葡萄
水果.txt:葡萄柚
```

## Advanced Usage and Techniques

### Using OR Operation

Search for lines containing "苹果" or "香蕉":

```bash
grep -E "苹果|香蕉" 水果.txt
```

Output:

```
苹果
香蕉
```

### Using AND Operation (Using Multiple grep Commands)

Search for lines containing both "a" and "e":

```bash
grep "a" 水果.txt | grep "e"
```

Output:

```
苹果
葡萄
葡萄柚
```

### Using grep with Command Output

List all .txt files in the current directory:

```bash
ls | grep "\.txt$"
```

Output:

```
水果.txt
蔬菜.txt
```

## Practical Application Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Analyzing Log Files

Assume we have a log file named `应用.log` with the following content:

```
2023-06-21 10:15:30 INFO 用户登录成功
2023-06-21 10:16:45 WARNING 数据库连接缓慢
2023-06-21 10:17:20 ERROR 支付处理失败
2023-06-21 10:18:00 INFO 用户注销
2023-06-21 10:19:30 ERROR 数据库连接丢失
```

Search for all error messages:

```bash
grep "ERROR" 应用.log
```

Output:

```
2023-06-21 10:17:20 ERROR 支付处理失败
2023-06-21 10:19:30 ERROR 数据库连接丢失
```

Count the number of each log level:

```bash
grep -c "INFO" 应用.log
grep -c "WARNING" 应用.log
grep -c "ERROR" 应用.log
```

Output:

```
2
1
2
```

### Scenario 2: Code Review

Assume we have a Python file `脚本.py`:

```python
import os
import sys

def main():
    print("你好，世界！")
    # TODO: 添加更多功能
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Find all TODO comments:

```bash
grep -n "TODO" 脚本.py
```

Output:

```
5:    # TODO: 添加更多功能
```

Find all import statements:

```bash
grep "^import" 脚本.py
```

Output:

```
import os
import sys
```

## Performance Optimization and Considerations

When using grep, especially with large files or complex searches, it's important to consider performance and proper usage.

### 1. Use -q Option for Silent Search

When you only need to know if a pattern exists without actual output, using the `-q` option can significantly improve performance.

```bash
if grep -q "error" 日志文件.txt; then
    echo "日志文件中发现错误"
else
    echo "日志文件中未发现错误"
fi
```

### 2. Use -F Option for Fixed String Search

When searching for fixed strings rather than regular expressions, using the `-F` option can improve search speed.

```bash
grep -F "精确短语" 大文件.txt
```

### 3. Limit Recursive Depth

When using the `-r` option to recursively search directories, you can use the `find` command to limit search depth and avoid unnecessary subdirectory searches.

```bash
find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -exec grep "模式" {} +
```

### 4. Use --exclude and --include Options

These options help skip unnecessary files or focus only on specific file types during search.

```bash
# 排除所有 .log 文件
grep -r "error" --exclude=*.log .

# 只在 .py 文件中搜索
grep -r "def main" --include=*.py .
```

### 5. Avoid Unnecessary Pipe Operations

Complete complex searches in a single grep command rather than using multiple pipes when possible.

```bash
# Not recommended
cat 文件.txt | grep "模式1" | grep "模式2"

# Recommended
grep "模式1" 文件.txt | grep "模式2"

# Better approach
grep -E "模式1.*模式2|模式2.*模式1" 文件.txt
```

### 6. Use LC_ALL=C for Performance Improvement

When processing ASCII text, setting `LC_ALL=C` can significantly improve grep's performance.

```bash
LC_ALL=C grep "模式" 大文件.txt
```

## Advanced Usage Examples

### 1. Using grep for Complex Log Analysis

Assume we have a complex log file `复杂.log`:

```
2023-06-22 10:15:30 [INFO] 用户 12345 登录
2023-06-22 10:16:45 [WARNING] 数据库查询缓慢: SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_login > '2023-06-21'
2023-06-22 10:17:20 [ERROR] 为用户 67890 处理支付失败: 余额不足
2023-06-22 10:18:00 [INFO] 用户 12345 注销
2023-06-22 10:19:30 [ERROR] 数据库连接丢失: 30 秒后超时
```

Extract all user IDs:

```bash
grep -oE "用户 [0-9]+" 复杂.log | sort | uniq
```

Output:

```
用户 12345
用户 67890
```

Extract all error messages:

```bash
grep "\[ERROR\]" 复杂.log | cut -d':' -f2-
```

Output:

```
 余额不足
 30 秒后超时
```

### 2. Using grep with CSV Files

Assume we have a CSV file `数据.csv`:

```
姓名,年龄,城市
John Doe,30,New York
Jane Smith,25,Los Angeles
Bob Johnson,45,Chicago
Alice Brown,35,San Francisco
```

Extract all people over 30 years old:

```bash
grep -E "^[^,]+,[3-9][0-9]," 数据.csv
```

Output:

```
John Doe,30,New York
Bob Johnson,45,Chicago
Alice Brown,35,San Francisco
```

### 3. Using grep for Simple Code Analysis

Assume we have a Python project directory and want to find all files using a specific function:

```bash
grep -r "def process_data" --include=*.py .
```

This will search for "def process_data" in all .py files in the current directory and subdirectories.

### 4. Using grep and Regular Expressions to Validate Data Formats

Validate email address formats in a file:

```bash
grep -E "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$" 邮箱.txt
```

This will match most valid email address formats.

### 5. Combining grep with Other Commands

Count TODO comments in code:

```bash
grep -r "TODO" --include=*.{py,js,java} . | wc -l
```

This searches for "TODO" in all .py, .js, and .java files and counts the matching lines.

## Conclusion

grep is a powerful and flexible text search tool, and mastering it can greatly improve your efficiency in handling text data. With the detailed explanations and rich examples in this guide, you should be able to better understand various usages of grep and apply them flexibly in your daily work.
