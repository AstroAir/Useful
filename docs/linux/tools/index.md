## Key Concepts

### Pattern Matching

- **Literal Strings** - Exact text matching
- **Regular Expressions** - Pattern-based matching
- **Case Sensitivity** - Controlling case-sensitive searches
- **Word Boundaries** - Matching complete words
- **Line Anchors** - Beginning and end of line matching

### File Operations

- **Single File Search** - Searching within individual files
- **Multiple File Search** - Searching across multiple files
