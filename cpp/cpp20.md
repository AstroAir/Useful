# C++20: A Comprehensive English Tutorial

## Introduction

C++20 represents a significant evolution in the C++ programming language, introducing numerous new features and improvements that enhance both the language's expressiveness and its efficiency. This tutorial provides a detailed exploration of C++20's key features, offering insights into their usage, benefits, and implementation details. Whether you're a seasoned C++ developer looking to update your skills or a beginner interested in modern C++, this guide will serve as your comprehensive resource to mastering C++20.

## Core Language Features

### Concepts

Concepts in C++20 represent a revolutionary approach to writing templates. They allow you to define constraints on template parameters, improving code readability and maintainability. The primary goal of concepts is to model semantic categories (like Number, Range, RegularFunction) rather than just syntactic restrictions (HasPlus, Array) [[18](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constraints)].

#### Basic Usage

Concepts enable you to specify what operations are required for a type to be used in a particular context. For example, if you want to write a function that requires its argument to support addition, you can use the `std::ranges::addable` concept.

```cpp
template<concept std::ranges::addable T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Prior to concepts, achieving similar type checking would require complex SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) techniques, making code harder to read and maintain [[27](https://www.cppstories.com/2021/concepts-intro/)].

#### Standard Library Concepts

C++20 introduces a set of predefined concepts in the standard library, which can be used to constrain template parameters. These include:

- `std::equality_comparable` - Types that can be compared for equality
- `std::default_initializable` - Types that can be default-initialized
- `std::constructible_from` - Types that can be constructed from specific arguments
- `std::regular` - Types that are equality-comparable, swappable, and copyable/movable
These concepts provide a standardized way to express common requirements, promoting consistency across codebases [[30](https://nihil.cc/posts/cpp20_concept/)].

### Modules

Modules in C++20 offer a modern alternative to traditional header files, addressing many of their limitations and improving compilation times and code organization.

#### Basic Usage

A module is a collection of declarations and definitions that can be imported by other translation units. To create a module, you define it in a source file and specify its exports:

```cpp
// mymodule.cpp
export module MyModule;
export int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Other files can then import this module:

```cpp
// main.cpp
import MyModule;
int main() {
    int result = add(3, 4); // Uses the function from MyModule
    return 0;
}
```

This approach eliminates the need for header files and reduces redundant inclusions [[22](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/tutorial-named-modules-cpp?view=msvc-170)].

#### Submodules and Partitions

Modules can be organized into submodules for better structure:

```cpp
// mymodule/algorithm.cpp
export module MyModule::algorithm;
export int find_max(int* array, size_t size) {
    // Implementation
}
```

And imported selectively:

```cpp
import MyModule::algorithm; // Only imports the algorithm submodule
```

This selective import capability helps manage dependencies and improve compilation efficiency [[23](https://www.studyplan.dev/pro-cpp/modules)].

#### Compilation Process

Modules require a two-step compilation process:

1. First, the module is compiled into a Binary Module Interface (BMI) file
2. Then, the BMI file is used when compiling other files that import the module
This separation of interface from implementation significantly reduces compilation time, especially in large projects [[24](https://blog.imfing.com/2020/06/cpp-20-modules-hello-world/)].

### Coroutines

Coroutines in C++20 provide a powerful way to write asynchronous code that's both efficient and easy to read. A coroutine is a function that can suspend execution to be resumed later, making it ideal for handling I/O operations, animations, or any scenario requiring cooperative multitasking.

#### Basic Usage

A simple coroutine can be defined using the `co_await`, `co_yield`, and `co_return` keywords:

```cpp
async_task<int> computeAsync() {
    // Simulate some computation
    co_await std::chrono::milliseconds(100);
    return 42;
}
```

The caller can then await the result:

```cpp
async_task<void> main() {
    int result = co_await computeAsync();
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;
}
```

This syntax closely resembles the way synchronous code is written, making it easier to understand and maintain [[39](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines)].

#### Stackless Execution

One of the key features of coroutines is that they are stackless: they suspend execution by returning to the caller. This means they don't consume stack space while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete, making them more efficient than traditional threading approaches [[39](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines)].

#### Use Cases

Coroutines are particularly useful in scenarios where:

- You need to perform multiple I/O operations concurrently
- You're implementing complex state machines
- You're working with real-time systems that require deterministic resource usage
- You're developing games or simulations that need to manage multiple simultaneous processes
Their ability to suspend and resume execution makes them a perfect fit for these kinds of applications [[37](https://www.scs.stanford.edu/~dm/blog/c++-coroutines.html)].

### Ranges

The Ranges library in C++20 revolutionizes how we work with collections of data, providing a modern, consistent, and flexible way to perform operations on sequences.

#### Basic Usage

The Ranges library introduces the concept of Views, which are a new composable approach to algorithms. Views allow you to chain operations together in a way that's both intuitive and efficient:

```cpp
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    
    // Use ranges to filter even numbers and multiply by 2
    auto transformed = v | std::views::filter([](int x) { return x % 2 != 0; })
                         | std::views::transform([](int x) { return x * 2; });
    
    // Print the results
    for (int num : transformed) {
        std::cout << num << " ";
    }
    // Output: 2 6 10
}
```

This example demonstrates how ranges allow you to create a pipeline of operations that's both readable and efficient [[33](https://itnext.io/c-20-ranges-complete-guide-4d26e3511db0)].

#### Lazy Evaluation

One of the key features of ranges is lazy evaluation. Operations on ranges are not executed immediately but are deferred until the results are actually needed. This allows for significant performance improvements, especially when working with large datasets or complex transformations [[34](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/600126585)].

#### Range Adapters

Ranges come with a variety of built-in adapters that make common operations straightforward:

```cpp
// Reversing a range
for (int i : v | std::views::reverse) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
}
// Output: 5 4 3 2 1
// Converting to a different type
auto doubles = v | std::views::transform([](int x) { return static_cast<double>(x); });
```

These adapters can be combined in any way, allowing for expressive and concise code [[36](https://www.cnblogs.com/bxjz/p/ranges.html)].

### Three-Way Comparison

The three-way comparison operator `<=>` in C++20 provides a concise and efficient way to compare objects, returning one of three possible outcomes: less than, equal to, or greater than.

#### Basic Usage

The three-way comparison operator is often just called the spaceship operator due to its appearance. It compares two items and describes the result [[43](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220516-52/?p=106661)]:

```cpp
struct Point {
    int x, y;
    
    // Define the three-way comparison
    auto operator<=>(const Point& other) const = default;
};
Point p1{1, 2};
Point p2{3, 4};
std::cout << (p1 <=> p2) << std::endl; // Output: -1 (p1 is less than p2)
```

The result of the `<=>` operator is of type `std::strong_ordering`, which can be one of:

- `-1` (less than)
- `0` (equal to)
- `1` (greater than)

#### Default Comparisons

C++20 also introduces default comparison operators for classes. If you don't define any comparison operators for your class, the compiler can generate them for you:

```cpp
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;
};
Person p1{"Alice", 30};
Person p2{"Bob", 25};
if (p1 > p2) {
    // This comparison works without explicitly defining operator>
}
```

Comparison operator functions can be explicitly defaulted to request the compiler to generate the corresponding default comparison for a class [[44](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/default_comparisons)].

#### Use Cases

The three-way comparison operator is particularly useful in:

- Custom data structures where natural ordering is needed
- Sorting algorithms
- Binary search operations
- Any scenario where you need to determine the relative order of two objects
It provides a single point of definition for comparison logic, reducing code duplication and maintaining consistency across different comparison operations [[42](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-20-the-three-way-comparison-operator/)].

### Lambda Improvements

C++20 significantly enhances lambda expressions, making them more powerful and flexible. These improvements bring lambdas closer to manually defined function objects while maintaining their conciseness and convenience.

#### Template Parameters for Lambdas

One of the most notable improvements is the ability to define template parameters for lambdas:

```cpp
auto add = [](auto a, auto b) { return a + b; }; // Pre-C++20
// C++20 allows explicit template parameters
auto add = [](typename T, T a, T b) { return a + b; };
```

This explicit typing can improve code clarity and performance, especially when working with complex types or when the lambda is used in contexts where type deduction isn't sufficient [[46](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/more-powerful-lambdas-with-c-20/)].

#### Capture Expressions

C++20 introduces "pack init-capture", which provides a concise and intuitive way to capture parameter packs in lambda expressions:

```cpp
template<typename... Args>
void example(Args... args) {
    // C++17 way
    auto f1 = [&, args...]() { /* use args... */ };
    
    // C++20 way
    auto f2 = [args...]() { /* use args... */ };
}
```

This syntax simplifies the capture of parameter packs, making the code cleaner and less error-prone [[48](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_21438461/article/details/132974126)].

#### Classic Syntax for Lambda Definitions

Another enhancement in C++20 is the introduction of a classic syntax to define lambdas, bringing them even closer to manually defined function objects:

```cpp
auto f = [](int x) { return x * 2; }; // Traditional lambda syntax
// C++20 alternative syntax
auto f = [] (int x) -> int { return x * 2; };
```

This syntax makes lambda definitions more explicit and consistent with function declarations [[47](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2021/12/13/the-evolutions-of-lambdas-in-c14-c17-and-c20/)].

### Constexpr and Consteval

C++20 enhances compile-time programming with the introduction of `consteval` functions, which complement the existing `constexpr` functions.

#### Constexpr Functions

A `constexpr` function can be executed at compile time when used in a `constexpr` context, or it can be executed at runtime:

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
int main() {
    constexpr int a = square(5); // Compile-time evaluation
    int b = square(5);           // Run-time evaluation
    return 0;
}
```

#### Consteval Functions

A `consteval` function must run at compile time when used in a `constexpr` context, or the result is requested at compile time:

```cpp
consteval int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
int main() {
    constexpr int a = square(5); // Must compile-time evaluate
    // int b = square(5);        // Compile-time error, cannot run at runtime
    return 0;
}
```

This distinction is important when working with functions that have side effects or require compile-time guarantees [[55](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/constexpr-and-consteval-functions-in-c-20/)].

#### Exception Handling in Constexpr

C++20 also improves `constexpr` functions by allowing try-catch blocks:

```cpp
constexpr int safeDivide(int a, int b) {
    try {
        if (b == 0) throw std::runtime_error("Division by zero");
        return a / b;
    } catch (const std::runtime_error& e) {
        return 0;
    }
}
```

In this example, the exception-handling structures are ignored in constant expressions, but the function can still return a valid value even when division by zero occurs [[57](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/exploring-c-20-features-exception-handling-in-constexpr-functions-and-deprecation-of-comma-39c749cd64c9)].

### Volatile and Other Small Improvements

C++20 includes several smaller but useful improvements to the language, including changes to how `volatile` is handled and other quality-of-life enhancements.

#### Volatile Qualifier

C++20 makes several changes to the `volatile` qualifier to make it more useful and less error-prone:

- Access to volatile objects is now sequenced
- Consecutive accesses to volatile objects cannot be reordered
- The compiler must respect the volatility of references
These changes make `volatile` more predictable and easier to use in concurrent programming scenarios [[58](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/volatile-and-other-small-improvements-in-c-20/)].

#### Other Language Improvements

C++20 introduces numerous smaller features and improvements related to `constexpr`, union, and other language constructs. With around 70 language features and 80 library changes in C++20, there's a lot to explore beyond the major features [[59](https://www.cppstories.com/2022/20-smaller-cpp20-features/)].

## Standard Library Features

### Formatting Library

The formatting library in C++20 provides a safe and extensible alternative to the `printf` family of functions, complementing the existing C++ I/O facilities.

#### Basic Usage

The `std::format` function allows you to format arguments according to a format string and return the result as a string:

```cpp
#include <format>
#include <string>
#include <memory>
#include <chrono>
int main() {
    std::string name = "Alice";
    int age = 30;
    double height = 1.75;
    
    // Format a string with multiple arguments
    std::string greeting = std::format("Hello, {}! You are {} years old and {:.2f} meters tall.", name, age, height);
    
    // Format a string with named arguments (C++23)
    std::string farewell = std::format("Goodbye, {name}! You will be missed.", std::make_format_args(name=name));
    
    // Format a string with localization
    std::string number = std::format(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"), "{0,number} people attended the event.", 1234);
    
    // Format a string with custom types
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    std::string ptr_str = std::format("Pointer value: {}", ptr);
    
    // Format a string with time and date
    auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
    std::string time_str = std::format("{:%H:%M:%S}", now);
    
    return 0;
}
```

The format specifier allows you to specify the width, precision, and type of the value, providing fine-grained control over how data is presented [[61](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/format)].

#### Format String Syntax

The format string uses placeholders marked by curly braces `{}`, with optional format specifications:

```
{[argument_index][,alignment][:format_spec]}
```

For example:

- `{}` - Simple placeholder with default formatting
- `{0:d}` - Formats the first argument as a decimal integer
- `{-1}` - Formats the last argument with default formatting
- `{name}` - Formats the argument named "name" (C++23)
The format specifications cover a wide range of types, including:
- `d` - Decimal integer
- `x` - Hexadecimal integer
- `f` - Fixed-point floating-point
- `e` - Exponential floating-point
- `s` - String
- `c` - Character
- `p` - Pointer
- `b` - Boolean
And many more, providing comprehensive formatting capabilities [[64](https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/the-formatting-library-in-c20-the-format-string/)].

### String Views

The `std::string_view` class template in C++17 (and enhanced in C++20/23) provides an efficient way to work with string data without owning it, offering performance benefits and reducing unnecessary string copies.

#### Basic Usage

`std::string_view` can be used to optimize both performance and readability in code sections that handle strings:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
void processString(const std::string& str) {
    std::string_view view(str);
    
    // Search for a substring
    size_t pos = view.find("example");
    if (pos != std::string_view::npos) {
        std::cout << "Found at position: " << pos << std::endl;
        
        // Extract a substring
        std::string_view substring = view.substr(pos, 7);
        std::cout << "Substring: " << substring << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Iterate over characters
    for (char c : view) {
        std::cout << c << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}
int main() {
    // Create a string view from a literal
    std::string_view view1 = "Hello, World!";
    
    // Create a string view from a std::string
    std::string str = "Hello, World!";
    std::string_view view2(str);
    
    // Create a string view from a character array
    char arr[] = "Hello, World!";
    std::string_view view3(arr, 13);
    
    return 0;
}
```

`std::string_view` can be used to optimize both performance and readability in code sections which handle strings. However, it could also cause unwanted behavior if not used correctly [[69](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5359566/The-View-of-the-String-Breaking-Down-std-string-vi)].

#### Six Handy Operations for String Processing

C++20 and C++23 introduce six practical string processing operations that enhance the capabilities of string views:

1. **Concatenation**: Efficiently concatenate multiple string views
2. **Join**: Join a range of string views with a delimiter
3. **Transform**: Apply a transformation function to each character
4. **Replace Substring**: Replace occurrences of a substring with another string
5. **Split**: Split a string view into parts based on a delimiter
6. **Partition**: Partition a string view into substrings based on a predicate
These features represent an evolution in string processing, making it more efficient and expressive [[66](https://www.cppstories.com/2023/six-handy-ops-for-string-processing/)].

#### String View Adapters

C++20 introduces several string view adapters that provide specialized views of string data:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::string str = "Hello, World!";
    
    // Create a const string view from the string
    std::string_view view(str);
    
    // Create a mutable string view (C++20)
    std::stringMutableView mview(str);
    
    // Create a reverse string view
    std::string_view reverse_view(str.rbegin(), str.rend());
    
    // Create a transformed string view
    auto upper_view = std::views::all(str) | std::views::transform([](char c) { return toupper(c); });
    
    // Create a filtered string view
    auto vowels_view = std::views::all(str) | std::views::filter([](char c) { return std::string("aeiouAEIOU").find(c) != std::string::npos; });
    
    return 0;
}
```

These adapters allow you to work with different aspects of string data without modifying the original string, promoting efficient and expressive string processing [[68](https://www.studyplan.dev/pro-cpp/string-views)].

### Smart Pointers

C++20 continues to evolve smart pointers, providing more capabilities and use cases for these essential resource management tools.

#### Shared Pointers

`std::shared_ptr` is a smart pointer that owns (is responsible for) and manages another object via a pointer and subsequently disposes of that object. One of its key features is reference counting, which allows multiple shared pointers to share ownership of the same object:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    // Create a shared_ptr
    std::shared_ptr<int> ptr1 = std::make_shared<int>(42);
    
    // Copy the shared_ptr (share ownership)
    std::shared_ptr<int> ptr2 = ptr1;
    
    // The use_count() method returns the number of shared owners
    std::cout << "Use count: " << ptr1.use_count() << std::endl; // Output: 2
    
    // The get() method returns the raw pointer
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr1.get() << std::endl; // Output: 42
    
    // Access the managed object using operator*
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr1 << std::endl; // Output: 42
    
    // Check if a shared_ptr owns an object
    if (ptr1) {
        std::cout << "ptr1 owns an object" << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Reset the shared_ptr (decrement the use count)
    ptr2.reset();
    
    // The use_count() method now returns 1
    std::cout << "Use count: " << ptr1.use_count() << std::endl; // Output: 1
    
    return 0;
}
```

A shared_ptr can share ownership of an object while storing a pointer to another object. This feature can be used to point to member objects [[52](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr)].

#### Unique Pointers

`std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that owns (is responsible for) and manages another object via a pointer and subsequently disposes of that object. Unlike `std::shared_ptr`, a `std::unique_ptr` provides exclusive ownership:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    // Create a unique_ptr
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42);
    
    // Access the managed object using operator*
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Output: 42
    
    // Move the unique_ptr (transfer ownership)
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr2 = std::move(ptr);
    
    // The original ptr is now empty
    if (!ptr) {
        std::cout << "ptr does not own an object" << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Use the moved ptr2
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr2 << std::endl; // Output: 42
    
    // Reset the unique_ptr
    ptr2.reset();
    
    // The unique_ptr no longer owns an object
    if (ptr2) {
        std::cout << "ptr2 owns an object" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "ptr2 does not own an object" << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

`std::unique_ptr` is a smart pointer that owns (is responsible for) and manages another object via a pointer and subsequently disposes of that object [[53](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr)].

#### Raw Pointer Conversions

C++20 introduces new ways to convert between raw pointers and smart pointers, enhancing flexibility and safety:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    // Create a raw pointer
    int* raw_ptr = new int(42);
    
    // Adopt the raw pointer into a unique_ptr
    std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(raw_ptr);
    
    // The raw pointer is now managed by the unique_ptr
    // Deleting it would cause a double-free error
    // delete raw_ptr; // Unsafe
    
    // Access the managed object
    std::cout << "Value: " << *ptr << std::endl; // Output: 42
    
    return 0;
}
```

This capability allows you to safely manage memory that was previously allocated with raw pointers, reducing the risk of memory leaks and double deletions.

#### Smart Pointer Use Cases

Smart pointers are particularly useful in scenarios where:

- You need to manage the lifetime of dynamically allocated objects
- You want to avoid memory leaks and double deletions
- You're working with complex data structures that require shared ownership
- You're implementing resource management for objects that are expensive to copy
- You need to manage resources other than memory, such as file handles or network connections
By using smart pointers, you can write safer and more maintainable code, reducing the risk of resource leaks and dangling references.

## C++20 Compiler Support

### Compiler Support Overview

C++20 introduces numerous new features and language extensions, and compiler support varies across different compilers. Understanding which features are supported by your compiler is crucial for effective C++20 development.

#### Major Compiler Support

Different compilers implement C++20 features at different rates. The following table provides an overview of C++20 core language features and their support status in major compilers:

| Feature | GCC | Clang | MSVC | Intel |
|---------|-----|-------|------|-------|
| Access checking on specializations | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Default constructible and assignable stateless lambdas | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Designated initializers | Partial | Partial | Partial | Partial |
| Lambda parameters | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Modules | Experimental | Experimental | Yes | No |
| Ranges | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial |
| Coroutines | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| Concepts | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
This table is based on the official compiler support documentation for C++20 [[13](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/20)].

#### Compiler Options

To enable C++20 features in your compiler, you typically need to specify the appropriate language standard option:

- **GCC and Clang**: Use `-std=c++20`
- **MSVC**: Use `/std:c++20` or `/Qstd:c++20`
- **Intel**: Use `-std=c++20` or `/Qstd=c++20`
Using these options ensures that your compiler recognizes and correctly processes C++20 syntax and features [[16](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/c20-features-supported-by-intel-cpp-compiler.html)].

### Migration Considerations

Moving to C++20 from earlier C++ standards requires careful consideration of several factors to ensure a smooth transition and maximize the benefits of the new features.

#### Key Migration Steps

Here are some recommended steps for migrating to C++20:

1. **Update your build system**: Ensure your build system supports the C++20 standard and the appropriate compiler options.
2. **Identify compiler support**: Determine which C++20 features are supported by your compiler and plan accordingly.
3. **Replace deprecated features**: Identify and replace any deprecated C++ features in your codebase with their modern C++20 equivalents.
4. **Adopt new idioms**: Update your coding practices to take advantage of C++20's new features and idioms.
5. **Test thoroughly**: Conduct thorough testing to ensure that your migrated code behaves as expected.

#### Migration Challenges

Several challenges may arise during the migration process:

- **Feature completeness**: Not all C++20 features are fully implemented in all compilers.
- **Library compatibility**: Some libraries may not yet be fully compatible with C++20.
- **Learning curve**: Developers may need time to become familiar with C++20's new features and best practices.
- **Toolchain support**: Development tools, IDEs, and static analyzers may not fully support C++20 initially.
- **Performance considerations**: Some C++20 features may have different performance characteristics than their C++17 counterparts.

#### Migration Best Practices

To ensure a successful migration to C++20, consider the following best practices:

- **Start with a small project**: Migrate a small, well-contained project first to gain experience with C++20 in your environment.
- **Use feature branches**: Create feature branches for C++20 migrations to isolate changes and make it easier to roll back if necessary.
- **Implement incrementally**: Introduce C++20 features one at a time rather than attempting a complete migration in one step.
- **Leverage gradual adoption**: Use compiler warnings and options to gradually adopt new C++20 practices.
- **Document changes**: Keep detailed documentation of the changes made during the migration process for future reference.
- **Seek community support**: Engage with the C++ community for guidance and best practices related to C++20 adoption.
By following these steps and considerations, you can successfully migrate your codebase to C++20 and start taking advantage of its powerful new features while minimizing disruption and risk.
